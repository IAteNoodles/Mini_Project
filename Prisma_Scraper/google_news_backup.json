      "content": "Sri Venkateswara Vedic University (SVVU) Vice-Chancellor Rani Sadasiva Murty emphasised the role of technology in modern pedagogy and called it a vital cog in taking Sanskrit literature across the globe.\nAt the international conference ‘Empowerment of education through technology and innovations in pedagogical practices’, organised by the National Sanskrit University (NSU) here on Tuesday, Mr. Murty underscored the indispensability of technology in contemporary education.\nHe also highlighted the role of technology as a vital medium in taking any subject to the reach of the global audience. Echoing a similar view, Prahlad R. Joshi, Vice-Chancellor of Kumar Bhaskar Varma Sanskrit and Ancient Studies University, Nalbari (Assam), explained the transformative potential of digital platforms in making Sanskrit’s timeless wisdom accessible worldwide.\nInternational delegates such as H. Lucy Guest from the United Kingdom, Krishnakeerthi Prabhu of the ISKCON order (USA) and Tikaram Nyaopane and Navaraj Katle (Nepal) explained Sanskrit’s profound relevance to universal knowledge systems, philosophy, science and spirituality.\nThe speakers reiterated that ancient Sanskrit texts embodied remarkable scientific insights which continue to inspire solutions in education, health and technology.\nIn his presidential address, NSU Vice-Chancellor G.S.R. Krishnamurthi recalled the varsity’s strides made in blending traditional scholarship with modern technological advancements. NSU Dean, School of Education, P. Venkat Rao and Finance Officer Radha Govind Tripathi also spoke.

      "headline": "China’s war technology on parade - Reuters",
      "content": "China’s war technology on parade\nSea drones, laser weapons and more were unveiled in China’s most advanced display of military weaponry yet. See how it stacks up against 2015 and 2019.\nChina on Wednesday staged its first major military parade in six years, showcasing progress in its long-running military modernisation in weapons ranging from torpedo-like sea drones to long-range missiles.\nAhead of the parade, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two, Chinese officials said the military was displaying how it could harness technological advances to win future wars. Foreign analysts said they were watching closely to see how effectively China could deter and intimidate not just the United States and its allies but other rivals too.\nMilitary hardware\nThis year China unveiled progress on all fronts, including the vital battle management and communications systems it would need to tie all its weaponry together in a conflict.\nAn earlier “Victory Parade” in 2015 showcased progress on its nuclear-capable missile arsenal and another display in 2019 revealed drones among the weaponry on show for the first time.\nA comparison of the 2015, 2019 and 2025 military parades in China. It shows squares for each vehicle type, colour-coded according to different categories such as ballistic missiles or ICBMs and more. The 2025 parade was slightly longer than the 2019 one, and much longer than the 2015 one.\nWhat’s new this year\nA closer look at the pieces of equipment making a debut in the recent parade.\nNuclear triad\nChina for the first time displayed a full array of nuclear weapons that can be deployed from air, land and sea. These included an upgraded version of its DF-5C ballistic missile that can strike global targets, an air-launched weapon and the JL-3 - its most modern submarine-launched long-range ballistic missile.\nDF-61\nWestern military analysts are expected to scrutinise the appearance of the DF-61 intercontinental ballistic missile in the months ahead. A new weapon, it is road-mobile - like some other advanced Chinese missiles - allowing it to be moved and hidden, making it potentially less vulnerable than more traditional nuclear weapons based in silos deep in China’s hinterland.\nH-6N Strategic Bomber\nThe H-6N is a closely watched plane. While based on a Soviet-era design from the early days of the Cold War, it has been effectively re-built with more advanced systems to help it carry nuclear weapons and extend its range. H-6s have appeared on China’s coasts in recent months. It will eventually be replaced with a stealthier heavy bomber.\nJL-3\nNaval analysts say nuclear-armed and powered submarines are the most sensitive element of the strategic triad - ensuring a country has an ability to stage a nuclear counterstrike even if its land-based weapons are attacked. This is particularly important to China’s nuclear deterrence as it has long maintained a “no first use” nuclear policy. The JL-3 is its most advanced submarine-launched missile, deployed on submarines based on Hainan Island in the South China Sea.\nUnderwater drones\nThe emergence of undersea drones shaped like torpedoes, some of them large, has surprised some analysts. If produced cheaply on a large scale - and operationally effective - these could further add to the challenges faced by China’s naval rivals. Questions remain over quite how they will be deployed.\nLaser weapons\nChina has been developing laser weapons as a defence against drone attacks. The full range of its anti-drone systems on display at the parade included a missile gun, high-energy laser weapons and high-power microwave weapons. Some analysts believe laser weapons could be used to take out missiles or even satellites, but they remain under development. Microwaves are a more basic technology but potentially difficult to deploy, given the impact they can have on friendly forces and equipment.\nState media said the weapons on show represented a “triad” in the People’s Liberation Army’s anti-drone systems.\nHypersonic missiles\nThe parade featured hypersonic anti-ship missiles that China has previously tested against mock-ups of U.S. aircraft carriers. Those included the YJ-15, YJ-17, YJ-19 and YJ-20. This array includes cruise missiles with hypersonic glide warheads that could be deployed from land, ships and aircraft and raise potential risks for U.S. and allied ships in East Asia conflict scenarios.\nMethodology\nEquipment is counted by watching full videos released by China’s state-run television CCTV. Vehicles are plotted in order of appearance. Models of equipment are probable but not confirmed. Each is cross-referenced against previous Reuters images, images on military websites and, in some cases, the advice of military analysts. The hardware chart shows military equipment only, with no groups of people included. Cars, jeeps and motorbikes are also not included. Due to poor visibility, some vehicles may be miscounted.\nSources\nCCTV, Xinhua, International Institute of Strategic Studies, and assorted analysts\nEdited by\nSimon Scarr, Rebecca Pazos and Alex Richardson",

      "headline": "Trump Tariffs: Europe, CEO of one of the biggest American technology company has made 'complaint' to Dona - Times of India",
      "content": "Donald Trump recently slammed Europe and other nations for imposing Digital Tax on American technology companies. In a post on Truth social, Trump threatened to impose “substantial” tariffs on any country that enacts Digital Taxes. Now a report in Bloomberg claims that Trump's threat came after Meta Platforms Inc Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\nMark Zuckerberg raised concerns about these levies during a White House meeting. Trump added in the post that he would put all countries with such taxes “on notice” and would also impose export restrictions on US semiconductors.\nMeta generates the vast majority of its revenue through advertising targeted at Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp users. The president’s comments have reignited a long-running feud with US trading partners, one that started long before last week’s meeting with Zuckerberg. US officials have pressed the matter in trade talks with other nations and the European Union, arguing that digital taxes unfairly impact US tech companies such as Meta, Amazon.com Inc. and Google owner Alphabet Inc.\nDuring the meeting, which reportedly took place at the White House, the two men discussed digital taxes and the broader threat of what they consider European regulatory overreach. Meta, which makes most of its money from targeted advertising on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, is directly impacted by these taxes, which are imposed on the revenue tech companies generate from users in a specific country.\nChanged dynamics between Donald Trump and Mark Zuckerberg\nThe private White House meeting is the latest sign of a changed dynamic between Zuckerberg and Trump, who once called the Meta CEO a “criminal.” The two have been mending their relationship since Trump's return to power. Zuckerberg has reportedly made several visits to the White House and Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and his company also contributed $1 million to Trump’s inauguration.\nThe two have discussed topics ranging from artificial intelligence to European regulation of Big Tech. Trump publicly acknowledged the improved relationship on Tuesday during a Cabinet meeting when he held up a graphic given to him by Zuckerberg, showing the scale of a new Meta data center in rural Louisiana. Trump expressed awe at the project, stating he was told it would cost $50 billion.\nWhile the meeting with Zuckerberg appears to have directly preceded Trump's recent comments, the president's opposition to digital taxes is not new. His administration has consistently pressed other nations and the European Union on the issue, arguing that the taxes unfairly target U.S. tech companies.\nNations that currently have digital services taxes include France, Italy, Austria, Spain and the UK.",

The extensive 56th GST Council meeting, spanning 10.5 hours, provided a platform for the Centre and states to deliberate and discuss crucial tax proposals.\nThe GST Council endorsed a transition from the existing four-tier GST framework (5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent) to a simplified two-rate structure of 5 and 18 per cent.\nAdditionally, certain items like high-end vehicles, tobacco and cigarettes will attract a special 40 per cent rate.\nThe revised rates will come into effect from September 22, coinciding with Navratri, except for gutkha, tobacco and tobacco products and cigarettes.\nEssential food items will remain tax-free, whilst various everyday food products and beverages will likely see reduced rates from 18 per cent to 5 per cent. This includes butter, ghee, dry nuts, condensed milk, sausages, meat, sugar boiled confectionery, jam, fruit jellies, tender coconut water, namkeen, 20-litre packaged drinking water, fruit pulp, juice, milk-based beverages, ice cream, pastry, biscuits, corn flakes, cereals and sugar confectionery.\nThe tax rate for all varieties of chapati and paratha will be reduced from the current 5 per cent to nil.\nThe modifications to the GST structure are crucial for boosting domestic consumption and helping businesses counter the impact of the United States' 50% import duty on Indian products.\nAlso read |\nGST reforms: 0% GST on individual health and life insurance; reduced from 18%GST rate cuts: Key Highlights\n- GST exemption for all individual life insurance policies, including term life, ULIP, endowment policies, and their reinsurance to enhance accessibility and coverage for the general public.\n- Complete GST exemption for individual health insurance policies, encompassing family floater and senior citizen policies, along with their reinsurance to increase affordability and coverage.\n- Current 4-tier tax structure into a 'Simple Tax' system with two rates: 18% Standard Rate and 5% Merit Rate, plus a 40% special rate for select items.\n- GST reduction to 5% for everyday items from current 18% or 12%, including toiletries, household goods, bicycles, and kitchenware.\n- Zero GST on UHT milk, packaged chena, paneer, and Indian breads (Chapati, roti, paratha, parotta).\n- Lower GST to 5% from 12% or 18% on packaged foods including namkeens, Bhujia, sauces, noodles, chocolates, preserved meats, and dairy products.\n- GST reduction from 28% to 18% proposed for appliances, including air conditioners, 32-inch TVs, dishwashers, and vehicles under 350cc.\n- GST decreases to 5% from 12% for agricultural machinery, including tractors, harvesting equipment, and farming tools.\n- Reduction to 5% GST for labour-intensive products like handicrafts, stone blocks, and leather goods.\n- GST reductions for cement (28% to 18%), medicines (varying reductions including complete exemption for lifesaving drugs), medical equipment, automotive sector, textiles, fertilisers, renewable energy devices, hospitality services, and wellness services.\nPM Narendra Modi in his Independence Day address had announced the upcoming GST reforms and rate cuts, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman led these deliberations.\nThe rationalisation of rates would entail a financial impact of Rs 48,000 crore, which would be \"fiscally sustainable for Centre and state\", as confirmed by Revenue Secretary Arvind Shrivastava during a press briefing.\nHe emphasised that revenue implications are variable figures that fluctuate based on consumption patterns. \"Rate rationalisation results in buoyancy.

      "content": "Stay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n‘India kills us with tariffs’: Trump defends 50% levy, again claims New Delhi offered ‘no tariffs’\nUS President Donald Trump on Tuesday reiterated his accusation against India of charging one of the highest tariffs in the world, while defending the 50% tariff imposed on Indian imports\nUS President Donald Trump said that “India kills the US with tariffs” and repeated his claim that New Delhi had offered Washington “no tariffs,” amid fraying relations between the two countries.\n“They have tariffs against us. China, which kills us with tariffs. India kills us with tariffs. Brazil kills us” with tariffs, Trump said in an interview with The Scott Jennings Radio Show on Tuesday.\nTrump underscored that his decision to levy tariffs had forced countries such as India to make concessions.\n“I understood tariffs better than any human being in the world. And now with my tariffs, they were all dropping them. India was the most highly tariffed nation… And you know what, they’ve offered me no tariffs in India anymore. No tariffs,” Trump said.\n“If I didn’t have tariffs, they would never make that offer. They would never make that offer. So you have to have tariffs. We’re going to be economically strong,” he added.\nTrump’s defence of his administration’s tariff action comes in the backdrop of a US federal appeals court ruling most of the levies ‘illegal’. Trump said that the court case is sponsored by other nations because they’re taking advantage of us, and added that “…they’re not going to take advantage anymore”.\nWhile responding to a reporter later in the day, who asked whether the US President is interested in taking away some of the tariffs imposed on India, Trump said the “United States gets along with India very well but for many years it was a one-sided relationship…India was charging us tremendous tariffs, the highest in the world.”\nCiting an example of Harley Davidson, Trump said the US motorcycle company wasn’t able to sell in India due to a 200% tariff on a motorcycle. The US president added, “So what happens? Harley Davidson went to India and built a motorcycle plant. Now they don’t have to pay tariffs.”\nVIDEO | US President Donald Trump, in reply to a question on tariff on India, says, “We get along with India very well, but India has, you have to understand, for many years, it was a one-sided relationship only now, since I came along, and because of the power that we have with… pic.twitter.com/YdfwUbvaz0\n— Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) September 2, 2025\nTrump said India was doing business with the United States “because we weren’t charging them, foolishly, we weren’t charging them,” adding that India was then pouring its products in America.\n— JD Vance (@JDVance) September 1, 2025\n“They’d send it in, pour it into our country. Therefore it wouldn’t be made here, which is a negative, but we would not send in anything because they were charging us 100% tariffs,” Trump said.\nThe US President had Monday claimed that India “offered” to cut its tariffs to nothing, “but it’s getting late” as New Delhi purchases most of its oil and military equipment from Russia and very little from America.\nIn a post shared by US Vice President JD Vance on social media, Trump had said: “It has been a totally one sided disaster! Also, India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia, very little from the US. They have now offered to cut their Tariffs to nothing, but it’s getting late. They should have done so years ago. Just some simple facts for people to ponder!!!”\nWith inputs from PTI\nPhotos\n- 01\n- 02\n- 03\n- 04\n- 05",

      "content": "Russia's bigger oil discounts lure India, Trump's tariff gambit backfires: Report\nBetween August 27 and September 1 – right after Trump's tariffs came into effect – Indian refiners snapped up 11.4 million barrels of discounted Russian crude.\nUS President Donald Trump’s bid to choke off India’s oil trade with Russia through punishing tariffs is backfiring. Far from backing down, New Delhi is poised to buy even more Russian crude as Moscow dangles steeper discounts.\nRussian Urals crude is now being offered to India at $3 to $4 a barrel below Brent for shipments in late September and October, Bloomberg reported. Just weeks ago, the gap was $2.50; in July, barely $1.\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, state-run and private refiners in India snapped up 11.4 million barrels of Russian oil between August 27 and September 1 – right after US tariffs came into force.\n\"Indian refiners have continued to take Russian oil, despite a brief pause in early August, and cheaper Urals are likely to attract strong buying interest,\" the report said.\nTrade insiders told Reuters that Indian refiners plan to boost Russian oil purchases in September by 10 per cent to 20 per cent from August, or about 150,000 to 300,000 barrels a day,\nUS TURNS UP HEAT\nTrump slapped a 25 per cent penalty on top of existing 25 per cent levies on Indian exports last month, accusing New Delhi of bankrolling Moscow’s war in Ukraine. The move was an abrupt about-face from when Washington openly encouraged such imports.\nPushing back, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar argued that India’s oil trade with Russia keeps global prices stable, and that crude imports are both a national and international necessity.\nBut Team Trump wants New Delhi to capitulate to its demands. To crank up the pressure, White House adviser Peter Navarro called the Russia-Ukraine conflict “Modi’s war”. He also accused India of profiteering by refining and re-exporting Russian crude, branding it Kremlin’s “laundromat”.\nINDIA DEFIANT\nReacting sharply to the charges, Union Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said “nothing could be further from the truth”. He made it clear that India’s every transaction with Moscow is above board.\nBeyond the rhetoric, New Delhi is defiantly tightening bonds with Moscow and even warming to longtime rival Beijing.\nAt the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China earlier this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called ties with Russia “special” and backed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s call to rebuild relations as “partners rather than rivals”.\nBILLIONS SAVED THROUGH RUSSIA OIL TRADE\nSince 2022, India’s reliance on Russian oil has skyrocketed from under 1 per cent of imports to nearly 40 per cent. Indian refiners saved at least $17 billion between April 2022 and June 2025 thanks to discounted barrels, multiple analyses show.\nIndia insists its trade breaks no international laws, noting that sanctions do not cover crude imports. Officials have also accused the West of hypocrisy, pointing out that the EU and US still buy Russian goods worth billions.",

      "headline": "'Axis of upheaval': Putin and Kim flank Xi at Victory Day parade as China showcases military might - Firstpost",
      "content": "China is all set to stage what it calls its largest-ever military parade on Victory Day on Wednesday (Sept 3), using the occasion both to commemorate Japan’s surrender in World War II and to showcase its rising military power.\nMore than two dozen world leaders are expected to attend the spectacle, where China will roll out some of its newest and most advanced weapons. Weeks of rehearsals have been held in Beijing, with tight security across the capital.\n‘Axis of Upheaval’\nFor the first time, Xi Jinping, Putin, and Kim will appear together publicly — a moment Western analysts have dubbed an “Axis of Upheaval.” Putin and Kim signed a defence pact last year, while China remains Pyongyang’s only formal ally and a key partner for Russia.\nThe parade will also be attended by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Myanmar’s military ruler Min Aung Hlaing, along with a total of 26 foreign leaders and an estimated 50,000 spectators.\nVictory Day marks the 80th anniversary of Imperial Japan’s surrender in 1945. China formally designated September 3 as Victory Day in 2014. This year’s event will be Xi Jinping’s third military parade since taking office in 2012.\nThe 70-minute-long parade will display China’s growing military strength, featuring hypersonic weapons, nuclear-capable missiles, fighter jets, and underwater drones. Xi is also expected to deliver a keynote speech during the ceremony.",

      "content": "NEW DELHI:\nRashtriya Janata Dal leader\nTejashwi Yadav hit back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the mother 'abuse' row after the later tore into RJD and\nCongress, alleging that his late mother had been \"insulted\" during Bihar rally. Calling out\nPM Modi's \"double standards\", Yadav dug up comments from the past, including the infamous \"50 crore girlfriend\" and \"jersey cow\" remarks.\n\"If Modi calls someone’s mother a \"50 crore girlfriend,\" then bravo, Modi, bravo!\" the Bihar leader of opposition said in a post on X. \"If Modi refers to the wife of a brave martyred Prime Minister and the mother of the Leader of the Opposition as a \"widow\" or a \"Jersey cow,\" shameless people will say Modi gave a brilliant speech,\" he added.\n‘Insult To Every Mother’: PM Modi Tears Into Congress-RJD For Abusing His Late Mother\n\"These are people with double standards. They create distractions to divert attention from vote theft. A mother is a mother,\" he said.\nYadav also pointed out PM Modi's \"DNA\" comment made against his now ally and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar. He went on to highlight the prime minister's campaigns for rape convict Prajwal Revanna.\n\"If Modi questions Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s origins by saying his DNA is faulty, meaning his blood is impure and wrong, is that justified? Can JD(U) people clarify if the report from the nails and hair sent to the PMO has come back?\" he said.\n\"If Prime Minister Modi campaigns for Prajwal Revanna, who has been accused of raping women and girls, and appeals for his victory, that’s Modi’s masterstroke,\" he added.\nThe accusations went further, charging PM Modi of being \"silent\" when \"Biharis are insulted in Gujarat\". \"Thousands of farmers died during the farmers’ protests. Farmers and youth are committing suicide, workers walked miles during the lockdown, millions died, yet he didn’t cry. When our soldiers were martyred in Pulwama, Pehalgam, and Galwan Valley, his tears didn’t flow,\" he continued.\nThe controversy erupted after a video went viral on social media, purportedly showing unidentified men hurling abuses at PM Modi and his late mother from the stage of Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ in Darbhanga, held along with RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.\nReacting to this, PM Modi said, \"Mother is our world. Mother is our self-respect. I had not even imagined what happened a few days ago in this tradition-rich Bihar. My mother was abused from the stage of RJD-Congress in Bihar... These abuses are not just an insult to my mother. These are insults to the mothers, sisters and daughters of the country. I know... how bad all of you, every mother of Bihar, felt after seeing and hearing this! I know, as much pain as I have in my heart, the people of Bihar are also in the same pain.\"",
