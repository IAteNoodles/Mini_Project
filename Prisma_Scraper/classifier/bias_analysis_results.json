    "summary": "This Group\u2019s Definition of Antisemitism Is Providing Cover for Genocide The definition hardly refers to inequality or structural discrimination\u2014rather, it\u2019s a thinly veiled tool for prohibiting criticism of any sort about Israel. This article originally appeared at TomDispatch. To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch. While the IHRA claims that stereotyping or caricaturing Jews, or attributing a particular version of pro-Israel politics to Jews, is antisemitic, its own definition stereotypes, caricatures, and attributes a particular politics about Israel to Jews. Legal and Logical Contradictions: A Double Standard for Israel After suggesting that \u201cthe state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity\u201d must not be challenged, the IHRA then does step back and agree that \u201ccriticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. And all of those claims have been duly condemned by Israel and its allies. Israeli genocide historian Omer Bartov proceeded cautiously with his own judgment. There\u2019s More: It\u2019s Legally Binding Although the IHRA originally insisted that its definition was \u201cnon-legally binding,\u201d it is, in fact, becoming so. The group itself and major Jewish organizations in the United States have launched political campaigns to promote their definition and turn it into law.

Sincerely, Bhaskar Sunkara President, The Nation.",

    "summary": "TASMANIAN CHAOS CONTINUES If you thought the political chaos in Tasmania might be calming down after Jeremy Rockliff was reappointed as premier yesterday, I\u2019m afraid to say you\u2019d be wrong. As the AAP reports this morning, a second parliamentary showdown now looms following the recent snap state election, caused by Rockliff losing a no-confidence vote in June, with Labor leader Dean Winter announcing another no-confidence motion will be moved when parliament returns. The election on July 19 resulted in neither Rockliff\u2019s Liberals (14 seats) nor Winter\u2019s Labor (10 seats) winning the 18 seats required to control the lower house. As always with Trump\u2019s tariff \u201cannouncements\u201d, the newswire adds: \u201cThe tariffs would go into effect 21 days after the signing of the order, meaning that both India and Russia might have time to negotiate with the administration on the import taxes. \u201d The BBC highlights India\u2019s foreign ministry has called the tariff \u201cunfair, unjustified and unreasonable\u201d, adding in a statement: \u201cIt is therefore extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest. Everyone agrees this War must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come. \u201d The New York Times reports that in a call with European leaders on Wednesday, it was revealed Trump intends to meet with Putin in person as soon as next week, and then plans to hold a meeting between himself, Putin and Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Something had to give \u2014 and sure enough, less than two years after \u201cretiring to California\u201d, News Corp is launching the California Post, a new daily newspaper to be run out of Los Angeles (and edited by an Australian). \u201cLachlan and Rupert will have a lot of fun with it, at the minimum,\u201d one friend of the Murdochs told Crikey. Gerontocrats, like it or not, currently hold the future of the world in their palms. Are they up to it, or are they beginning to buckle. As AI algorithms infiltrate everyday lives, as populists revolt and postwar institutions crumble, so the political realm is changing at galloping pace \u2014 and guiding us through the tangle will be a bunch of old men (all men so far), analogue boomers who barely know how to organise their emails.",
