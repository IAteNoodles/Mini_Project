https://www.theverge.com/news/761582/apple-iphone-17-pro-max-air-india-china,"Apple is manufacturing more of its iPhone 17 phones for the US in India instead of in China, and for the first time, the full lineup of new models will ship from India at launch, according to Bloomberg. The company is also working on a successor to the iPhone 16E that it plans to make in India, Bloomberg says.
Apple is reportedly making more of its new iPhones in India instead of China
At launch, Apple’s factories in India will produce all four new iPhone 17 variants for the first time, according to Bloomberg.
At launch, Apple’s factories in India will produce all four new iPhone 17 variants for the first time, according to Bloomberg.
Apple has increasingly been moving iPhone production to India to reduce its dependence on manufacturing in China. The company already expects to pay $1.1 billion in tariffs for the current quarter, but Bloomberg reports that currently, Apple’s exports of iPhones to the US from India are exempted from tariffs. That’s despite the Trump administration’s 50 percent tariff on many imports from India, and while analyst Patrick Moorhead says.the move “does dodge some tariffs,” he noted that iPhone subassemblies are still mostly produced in China then shipped to India for final assembly.
Earlier this month, Apple announced a $100 billion investment in US manufacturing that builds on the $500 billion it announced earlier this year. Trump has claimed that companies committed to building products in the US would be exempt from future tariffs on imported chips.
However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday morning that the administration plans to increase tariffs on India, saying it’s a result of the country buying and selling Russian oil despite sanctions from the war in Ukraine.

https://gizmodo.com/tim-cook-to-appear-with-trump-at-the-white-house-as-apple-announces-100-billion-investment-2000639570,"Apple CEO Tim Cook will join President Donald Trump at the White House Wednesday afternoon to announce a new $100 billion pledge to invest in the United States, according to a report from CNBC. Dubbed the “American Manufacturing Program,” Cook’s appearance comes on the same day that Trump has pledged to raise tariffs on goods from India to 50%, though it’s still unclear if Apple’s goods manufactured in that country will be exempt from the historically high rate.
“Today’s announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America’s economic and national security,” a White House spokesperson told Bloomberg in a statement.
Apple has shifted more of its production to India in recent years. That shift has had a measurable impact on the smartphone market in the U.S., making India the source of most phones purchased in the U.S. for the first time as of last week, according to Bloomberg. Apple’s competitors, like Samsung, have also been moving production out of China. Many other electronics made by Apple, including MacBooks, iPads and Apple Watches, are now made in Vietnam.
Cook said on an earnings call that “the vast majority” of iPhones sold in the U.S. come from India, but that may not be enough for Trump, who wants those phones built in the U.S. The president said back in May, “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. I said to him, ‘My friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India.’ I don’t want you building in India.”
Apple announced a new $500 billion investment in the U.S. in April, and this new $100 billion commitment will be on top of that, according to Bloomberg. But Apple doesn’t plan on manufacturing any iPhones in the U.S., something that no doubt irks the president, who wants everything to be made in America. Trump has previously threatened a 25% tariff on all phones imported from other countries.
Members of the Trump regime have received criticism for imagining a world where everything is produced in the U.S., like when Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick appeared on Face the Nation the weekend after Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement in April.
Lutnick also seemed to suggest that most of the jobs coming back to the U.S. would be for robots and was ridiculed in a series of AI videos showing Americans in sweatshops. But the Commerce Secretary later insisted the jobs wouldn’t just be for robots.
Trump signed an executive order slapping India with an additional 25% tariff as punishment for buying Russian oil, which is scheduled to take effect later this month. That’s on top of another 25% tariff on Indian goods that will start Thursday. Trump has said he’s trying to punish countries that are doing business with Russia in an effort to stop the war in Ukraine. But so far, nothing has changed, and it’s unclear whether adding a whopping 25% tariff on India will do anything to end that conflict."

More than 100 people are missing and at least one has died after devastating flash floods in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand.
Rescue operations are under way in Uttarkashi district after a massive wave of water surged down the mountains into Dharali village on Tuesday, submerging roads and buildings in its path.
About 190 people have been rescued so far in the affected region, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said.
State officials said the flash flood was caused by a cloudburst - a sudden, intense downpour over a small area - but India's weather department has not confirmed this.
Damaged roads and heavy rain have hampered rescue teams trying to reach Dharali. Dhami flew in by helicopter on Wednesday and met some of the affected families.
Weeks of heavy rain have pounded Uttarakhand, with Uttarkashi - home to Dharali village - among the worst hit by flooding.
The floods struck on Tuesday around 13:30 India time (08:00 GMT), causing the Kheerganga river to swell dramatically and send tonnes of muddy water crashing down the hills.
Dharali is a summer tourist spot 2km from Harsil, home to a major Indian army base and an Indo-Tibetan Border Police camp. At least 10 soldiers stationed at the army base are also missing, officials said.
Rescue efforts are slow due to heavy sludge and debris, but officials have deployed helicopters to aid operations.
The sludge has also blocked part of the Bhagirathi river - which becomes India's holiest river Ganges once it travels downstream - forming an artificial lake that has submerged large areas, including a government helipad.
Officials worry that if this water is not drained out quickly, it can pose a serious threat to towns and villages downstream.
India's weather department has forecast heavy rain ahead and advised avoiding landslide-prone areas. Schools have closed in parts of the state.
In the past few days, officials had issued multiple rain alerts, discouraging tourists from visiting the region.
Dharali sees fewer visitors in monsoon season. The low footfall and warnings likely kept tourists safe during the deluge. Residents warn that a full crowd could have turned the incident into a far worse disaster.
Uttarakhand, located in the western Himalayas, is highly vulnerable to flash floods and landslides.
In 2021, more than 200 people died in flash floods triggered by a cloudburst.
One of the worst disasters to hit Uttarakhand was in 2013, when a cloudburst caused devastating floods and landslides that destroyed several villages and towns. Much of the damage took place in Kedarnath town, which is popular with Hindu pilgrims. Thousands of people were swept away, and many bodies were never recovered.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3mj0vkzro,"Health v heritage: Pigeon feeding ban sparks debate in India
A recent court ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in the western Indian city of Mumbai has become a major flashpoint between civic bodies, public health activists and bird lovers.
This month, hundreds of people clashed with police twice while protesting the closure of a decades-old pigeon feeding spot, or a kabutarkhana. (Kabutar is the Hindi word for pigeon.)
Some tore down the tarpaulin sheets covering the spot and threatened an indefinite hunger strike. Police briefly detained about 15 people at another protest, media reports said.
Authorities had imposed the ban due to concerns about health hazards due to pigeon droppings.
The problem is not unique to Mumbai. In Venice, feeding pigeons in historic squares is banned. Singapore imposes hefty fines, and New York and London have regulated feeding zones.
In India too, Pune and Thane cities in Maharashtra state - of which Mumbai is the capital - have imposed penalties on feeding pigeons. Delhi is mulling an advisory against feeding the birds in public spaces.
The crackdown has angered animal lovers and religious feeders, as pigeons are long woven into India's cultural fabric.
Films often use shots of grain-feeding pigeons to evoke cities like Mumbai and Delhi, where the birds are a familiar presence on balconies and air-conditioners.
Some of Mumbai's kabutarkhanas are iconic heritage structures and are said to have originated as charitable spaces where communities could donate grain.
There are religious sentiments involved as well. In Mumbai, the Jain community, which considers feeding pigeons a pious duty, has been vocal in their protests.
Elsewhere too, many share a bond with pigeons - seen as symbols of peace and loyalty .
In Delhi, Syed Ismat says he has been feeding the birds for 40 years and considers them his family.
""They are innocent. Perhaps the most innocent of all creatures. All they ask for is a little kindness,"" said Mr Ismat.
But these sentiments are pitted against studies which show that prolonged exposure to pigeon droppings poses risks of pulmonary and respiratory illnesses.
A boom in India's pigeon population in recent years has heightened this risk, prompting the restrictions.
Delhi-based biodiversity expert Faiyaz Khudsar says easy availability of food has led to overpopulation of pigeons in many countries.
In India, he said, the challenge is compounded by a decline in birds like the goraiya, commonly known as the house sparrow, which are increasingly being displaced by pigeons.
""With easy food and no predators, pigeons are breeding faster than ever. They are outcompeting other urban birds, creating an ecological loss,"" Mr Khudsar said.
The 2023 State of India's Birds report says pigeon numbers have risen more than150% since 2000 - the biggest jump among all birds - leaving homes and public spaces with droppings, as each bird can produce up to 15kg (33lbs) a year.
Studies show these droppings contain at least seven types of zoonotic pathogens that can cause diseases such as pneumonia, fungal infections and even lung damage in humans.
Nirmal Kohli, a 75-year-old Delhi resident, started complaining of persistent cough and had trouble breathing a few years ago.
""Eventually, a CT scan showed that part of her lung had shrunk,"" says her son Amit Kohli. ""The doctors said it was due to exposure to pigeon droppings.""
Last year, an 11-year-old boy died in Delhi due to hypersensitivity pneumonitis - a disease that causes inflammation in lungs. Doctors said the reason was prolonged exposure to pigeon droppings and feathers.
RS Pal, a pulmonologist, told the BBC that such cases were common.
""Even if you don't directly feed pigeons, their droppings on window sills and balconies can cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis,"" he said.
""We also see bacterial, viral and fungal infections in people handling pigeons regularly.""
These concerns are what led the Mumbai civic body to impose the feeding ban last month and launch a drive to demolish feeding centres.
Demolitions are on hold, but the Bombay High Court has dismissed a plea against the feeding ban, citing public health as ""paramount"" and ordering strict action on illegal feeding.
Delhi mayor Raja Iqbal Singh told the BBC that love for birds cannot come at the cost of people's well-being.
""Feeding spots often turn dirty, leading to foul smells, infections and pests. We are working to minimise feeding,"" he said.
But many animal lovers disagree.
Mohammad Younus, who supplies grains to a feeding spot in Delhi, argues that all animals can spread diseases if hygiene is not maintained.
""I have been surrounded by pigeons for the past 15 years. If something were to happen, it would have happened to me too,"" he said.
In Mumbai, a Jain monk told BBC Marathi that thousands of pigeons would die of hunger due to the feeding ban.
Megha Uniyal, an animal rights activist, pointed out that there was no clarity on how the ban on feeding pigeons would be implemented.
""As far as regulating pigeon feeding is concerned, it is a word thrown around by the authorities, but no one really understands what this could entail,"" she said.
Amid these competing contentions, efforts are on to find a middle ground.
Ujjwal Agrain, of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) India, suggests allowing pigeon feeding only during set morning and evening hours.
""That gives enough time for civic bodies to clean the place and maintain hygiene. This way, we respect both public health and emotional bonds,"" he said.
The Bombay High Court has set up an expert panel to suggest alternatives, and Mumbai civic officials say controlled, staggered feeding may be allowed based on its advice.
For Syed Ismat, the solution lies in rethinking the relationship between birds and urban spaces.
""Maybe it's time to reimagine how we share our cities, not just with pigeons but with all forms of life,"" he said.

- Published
Inside the JM Finn Stand at The Oval, opposite the pavilion, is a staircase that leads up to the Test Match Special commentary box. It is used by media and spectators alike.
In the hours after the sensational fifth Test between England and India ended, with the ground emptying, on that staircase was found a left shoe, then some underwear, then a right shoe.
Because of their size, they presumably belonged to a man. Quite how the owners misplaced them, or when they realised their loss, is unclear. However, it raises the prospect that someone left this famous old ground both shoeless and pantless.
It would have been entirely in keeping with the mayhem that had already played out on Monday morning.
There had been 57 minutes of the most intense, dramatic and emotional sport you could ever wish to see.
Twenty-five days of gripping Test cricket came down to a one-armed man painfully scampering 22 yards of south London turf. One wonders how the productivity of the UK was affected at the beginning of the working week, or how many offices in Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru closed early.
There had been an element of farce to the previous evening. Players went to the dressing rooms because of rain and bad light when the game was on a knife-edge, then stayed there as the gloom turned to evening sunshine.
Any frustration over the events of Sunday turned into anticipation of what might be possible on Monday. Thirty-five runs or four wickets. The Oval was sold out, but would anyone bother to turn up?
Turn up they did, filling this historic venue with constant noise and nervous energy. There were echoes of the 2005 Ashes classic in Birmingham, when Edgbaston was full for what might have only been two deliveries of action. Just like then, there was a rich reward for turning up. India's six-run win here is the narrowest of its kind in this country since England beat Australia by two runs 20 years ago.

India began the day with a huddle that seemed to have every member of the touring party included. Security, chef, bus driver. England, naturally, played football.
Fittingly, it was Surrey v England. When Jamie Overton took fours off each of the first two balls of the day, England had almost a quarter of the runs they required. It was the best it got.
Jamie Smith has looked increasingly frazzled in his first five-Test series as a wicketkeeper. He wafted at two deliveries, then edged the third. The dhol drum of the Bharat Army beat out the rhythm of We Will Rock You, and rocked England were. When Overton was struck on the pad, umpire Kumar Dharmasena paid his own 2005 tribute with the slow finger of Rudi Koertzen.
Josh Tongue had a scattergun game with the ball and found himself as the last line of defence before the stricken Chris Woakes.
On Sunday evening, Woakes somehow folded his dislocated shoulder into a set of cricket whites, which sounds excruciatingly painful in itself. When Tongue had his stumps rearranged by Prasidh Krishna, security staff rushed on to the outfield, believing the match to be over. They had not been briefed that Woakes, the nicest man in cricket, is also the bravest.
Earlier this year, Woakes had a tattoo inked on his left tricep in memory of his late father Roger, who died last year. Now the same arm was strapped under his England sweater as he descended the pavilion stairs, putting his broken body on the line for the Three Lions on his chest.
History will remember Woakes as a World Cup winner in both formats, an Ashes winner and one of the finest seamers in English conditions. This will trump them all. The Wizard will always be the man who tried to help England win a Test with only one functioning arm.
How painful it must have been for Woakes to run four times between the wickets, his shoulder jolted by every step. Mercifully, he never faced a delivery. While Woakes played Jack Leach, Gus Atkinson could not ape Ben Stokes. Atkinson was bowled attempting to hit the six that would have levelled the scores and won the series.
According to Stokes, Woakes' reaction in the dressing room was to ""shrug his shoulder"", which is probably the last thing he should have done.
The last word went to Mohammed Siraj, who personified the unbreakable spirit and never-say-die attitude of a young India team. He carried the torch of the retired Virat Kohli, with the ability to get into a fight in a phone box.
There was barely a time in this Test when Siraj was not bowling, haring in with the pavilion behind him. Thriving on responsibility, both Siraj's average and strike-rate are better when he is not playing in the shadow of Jasprit Bumrah. India's two wins in this series came in matches Bumrah did not play.
A series level at 2-2 was a fair result, even if England will feel aggrieved they were denied in the drawn fourth Test at Old Trafford. If they had caught Ravindra Jadeja on nought in Manchester, or any of the six they dropped in India's second innings here, it might have been different. The sight of India great Sunil Gavaskar leading his TV production staff in song on the Oval outfield said much about which side would be happier with the result.
It was highly creditable for England to get so close to chasing down 374, what would have been their second highest of all time. It was also a missed opportunity for a statement series win.
Whisper it quietly, but there is a chance this was the last home Test for the England team as we know it.
There is certainly a scenario where a poor Ashes leads to one of captain Stokes or coach Brendon McCullum walking away. Stokes may simply decide he has had enough of rehabbing from injuries.
As cruel as it sounds, Woakes' heroics may be his last act in an England shirt. Mark Wood is 36 in January. England's next home Test is in June.
There was a moment on Saturday morning of this Test, when England were fielding and contemplating a potential DRS review. In the conversation were Smith, Atkinson, Zak Crawley, Jacob Bethell, Ollie Pope and Ben Duckett. It was a window into what the senior England players will look like the next time India tour this country.
If this is the end of something, England went out playing the hits. Attempting the unthinkable, stirring the emotions like few other teams can. They are exhilarating and infuriating in equal measure, never boring, and responsible for the rebirth of Test cricket in this country.
Crucially, the Bazball era is still to claim a top prize. The full home series against Australia and India played under Stokes and McCullum have been drawn 2-2. England have beaten neither since 2018, when Alastair Cook was still in the team. Trips to both countries have recently ended in shellackings, regardless of who has been in charge.
The next chance to change that record comes quickly, starting in Perth in November.
Bazball in Australia. The drama, emotion and craziness would be nice. A win would be better.

Auction house Sotheby's has returned a set of sacred jewels believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains to India, after facing mounting pressure from the Indian government and global Buddhist leaders.
The Piprahwa Gems - described by archaeologists as one of the most astonishing finds of the modern era - were due to be auctioned in Hong Kong in May. But the sale was called off following diplomatic intervention and threats of legal action from Delhi.
The Mumbai-based conglomerate Godrej Industries Group has acquired the jewels, Sotheby's said.
Sotheby's said it was ""delighted"" to facilitate the return, following two months of negotiations involving the owner, the new buyer and the Indian government. The relics will now go on permanent public display in India, the auction house said.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the return on Wednesday, calling it a ""proud and joyous moment"" and a victory for the country's cultural heritage. The relics, he said on X, were coming home after 127 years.
Godrej Industries Group, the buyer of the jewels, serves over 1.1 billion consumers worldwide across sectors including consumer goods, real estate, agriculture, finance, and chemicals, according to its website. Many of its products are household names in India.
""We are deeply honoured to contribute to this historic moment. The Piprahwa gems are not just artefacts - they are timeless symbols of peace, compassion, and the shared heritage of humanity,"" Pirojsha Godrej, Executive Vice Chairperson of Godrej Industries Group, was quoted as saying in a government press statement.
Unearthed in 1898 by English estate manager William Claxton Peppé from a stupa in Piprahwa in northern India, near the Buddha's birthplace, the cache included nearly 1,800 pearls, rubies, sapphires and gold sheets - buried alongside bone fragments identified by an inscribed urn as belonging to the Buddha himself.
Peppé eventually handed most of the gems, relics and reliquaries to the colonial Indian government: the bone relics went to the Buddhist King of Siam (Rama V). Five relic urns, a stone chest and most other relics were sent to the Indian Museum in Kolkata - then the Imperial Museum of Calcutta.
For over a century, the rest of the dazzling jewels remained largely hidden in a British private collection.
A set of 300 gems held by the Peppé family was publicly displayed at Sotheby's Hong Kong in February and May. Over the past six years, the gems have appeared in major exhibitions, including The Met in 2023. The family has also launched a website to share their research.
Historians consider the relics the shared heritage of the Buddha's Sakya clan and Buddhists worldwide. The bone fragments have since been distributed to countries like Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, where they remain objects of veneration.
The planned sale of the Buddha relics by Sotheby's in Hong Kong had sparked widespread ethical concerns, with scholars and Buddhist leaders questioning whether sacred objects - especially those linked to human remains - should be treated as commodities.
Critics challenged the seller's authority to auction the relics, while defenders said a transparent sale was the fairest way to transfer custody. For many Buddhists, the jewels are inseparable from the sacred remains and meant to be venerated, not sold.
""Are the relics of the Buddha a commodity that can be treated like a work of art to be sold on the market?"" Naman Ahuja, a Delhi-based art historian, had told the BBC in May. ""And since they aren't, how is the seller ethically authorised to auction them?
""Since the seller is termed the 'custodian', I would like to ask – custodian on whose behalf? Does custodianship permit them now to sell these relics?""
Chris Peppé, great-grandson of William, had told the BBC in May that the family looked into donating the relics, but all options presented problems and an auction seemed the ""fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists"".
He said that in all the monasteries he had visited ""no Buddhists regard these as corporeal relics"".
""A few Buddhist academics at Western universities have recently offered a convoluted, fact-defying logic whereby they may be regarded as such. It's an academic construct that is not shared by Buddhists in general who are familiar with the details of the find,"" he said.
On 7 May, Sotheby's postponed the auction of the jewels following media reports and concerns raised by the Indian government, citing the need for further discussions. A week later, it confirmed ongoing talks with India to find a mutually agreeable resolution.
This week, confirming the return of the jewels, Sotheby's said it was ""grateful to the Peppé family for having safeguarded the gems and for having worked with us – and with the Government of India - in good faith to achieve this historic outcome""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r4nr2zy2do,"Why India tops the list of abandoned sailors
Manas Kumar* has been abandoned on a cargo ship in Ukrainian waters since April.
The Indian seaman was part of a crew of 14 transporting popcorn to Turkey from Moldova when the vessel was raided on 18 April, as it made its way down the Danube river which divides Ukraine and Romania.
Ukraine claimed the vessel, Anka, was part of Russia's ""shadow"" fleet, which it said was being used to sell ""looted"" Ukrainian grain to third countries.
But Mr Kumar, who is Anka's chief officer, said that the vessel was running under the flag of Tanzania and was managed by a Turkish company.
But exactly who owns the ship is not clear from the papers provided by the crew, made up of Mr Kumar, five other Indian nationals, as well as two Azerbaijanis and six Egyptians.
All are still on board, five months later - despite Ukrainian authorities informing them they were free to leave as they were not under investigation, Mr Kumar said.
The problem is disembarking means the crew losing their salaries - amounting to $102,828 by June all together, according to a joint database of abandoned ships maintained by International Labour Organization (ILO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO).
The BBC has reached out to the ship's management and owners on details provided by the crew.
Mr Kumar says that the crew was not aware of the ship's past at the time of taking the job. Now stuck in a situation far beyond their control, the crew wants a quick resolution.
He says the owner and Indian shipping officials keep asking us for one more day to resolve the crisis but nothing promising has come out yet.
""This is a war zone. All we want is to return home quickly,"" he told the BBC.
India is the second-largest supplier of sailors and crew of commercial ships globally.
But it also tops the list of crew members known as ""abandoned seafarers"" - a term used by 2006 Maritime Labour Convention to describe the situation when shipowners sever ties with the crew and fail to provide them for repatriation, regular provisions and wages.
According to the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), which represents seafarers globally, there were 3,133 abandoned sailors across 312 ships in 2024 - of which Indian nationals accounted for 899.
For many, leaving the ship without a salary is not possible - especially if they have already paid hefty sums to agents for landing the job or for acquiring training certifications, Mohammad Gulam Ansari, a former seafarer who helps repatriate Indian crew from other parts of the world, tells the BBC.
The most significant reason for abandonment is the widespread practice of registering ships - called flags of convenience - in countries that have weak shipping rules, according to ITF.
International maritime rules allow a ship to be registered or flagged in a country different from its owners.
""A country can set up a ship registry and charge fees to shipowners, while having reduced standards for crew safety and welfare and often failing to live up to the responsibilities of a genuine flag state,"" the ITF website states.
This system, the group says, also obscures the identity of the real owner, which helps dubious owners ply ships.
ITF data shows that in 2024, around 90% of the abandoned vessels sailed under a flag of convenience.
But complications arise also because of the globalised nature of the shipping industry, with owners, managers, flags and crews of the ship often coming from different countries, industry observers say.
On 9 January 2025, Captain Amitabh Chaudhary* was steering a cargo vessel from Iraq to the United Arab Emirates when bad weather forced him to make a slight detour.
Minutes later, Tanzania-flagged Stratos vessel hit rocks underneath and damaged its oil-laden tank, forcing an unplanned stall near Saudi Arabia's Jubail port.
The crew - including nine Indians and one Iraqi - made several attempts to float it again but they failed.
Stuck, they waited there for help for nearly six months before the ship was refloated.
The ship's Iraqi owner, meanwhile, refused to pay their salaries citing losses incurred due to the stalled vessel, Mr Chaudhary told the BBC.
The BBC reached out to the owners of the ship for a response to these allegations but they didn't respond.
Seafarers often blame India's maritime regulator, Directorate General (DG) of Shipping - which is tasked with verifying the credentials of ships, their owners and recruitment and placement agencies - for lax scrutiny of stakeholders. The DG Shipping didn't respond to a request for comment.
Others, however, point out that even the crew needs to be more vigilant.
""When you are hired, you get enough time to inform the DG Shipping [about any discrepancies in your contract],"" said Sushil Deorukhkar, an ITF representative working for the welfare of the seafarers. ""Once you sign the papers, you are stuck and have to knock on every door for resolution.""
Things can get complicated even for the crew on Indian-owned ships operating within the country's waters for a variety of reasons.
Captain Prabjeet Singh was employed on Nirvana, an Indian-owned, Curacao-flagged oil tanker, with 22 other Indian crew members. It had recently been sold to a new owner, who wanted it decommissioned, and their salary was under dispute between the new and old owners.
In early April, Mr Singh was taking it to a port in western India's Gujarat state for dismantling when an Indian court ordered its seizure ""for non-payment of crew"", according to the ILO-IMO database.
Within days, the crew realised they were abandoned, Mr Singh said. ""We were without adequate food and provisions. The ship had run out of diesel and was in complete blackout,"" Mr Singh told the BBC. ""We were forced to break and burn the ship's wood to cook food.""
Hired in October 2024, Mr Singh had hoped to earn a decent living with this job, and that is why leaving the ship without salary was not a viable option for him.
The crew could finally disembark on 7 July after a court-ordered settlement. But the crew's wages remain unpaid despite the court order, according to the ILO-IMO database.
Back in the Gulf, the crew of Stratos said their biggest fear was that the hole in the ship's bottom would sink it.
But the immediate challenge, they found, was hunger.
""For days, we had to eat only rice or potatoes because there were no supplies,"" Mr Chaudhary told the BBC last week.
After nearly six months, the crew finally managed to float the ship back - but the accident had left its rudder damaged, making it unfit to sail.
The crew are still at the ship waiting for their salaries to be paid.
""We are still at the same place in the same situation. The mind has stopped working, can't think what [more] we should do,"" Mr Chaudhary said.
""Can we get some help? We just want to go home and meet our loved ones.""

US tariffs of 50% on goods from India took effect on Wednesday as Donald Trump sought to punish Delhi for buying Russian oil and weapons.
The tariffs – among the highest in the world – include a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia that are a key source of funds for its war in Ukraine.
India, a vital strategic US partner in the Indo-Pacific, has shown no signs of stopping its purchases, calling the tariffs unfair and vowing to choose the ""best deal"" on buying oil to protect its 1.4 billion people.
But there are fears exports and growth in the world's fifth largest economy could suffer. The US was, until recently, India's largest trading partner.
The tariff setback has sent the Indian government into firefighting mode.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to cut taxes to mitigate the impact of the tariffs which will disrupt millions of livelihoods across the country's export-driven industries that supply everything from clothes to diamonds and shrimp to American consumers.
He said a Diwali gift in the form of a ""massive tax bonanza"" was on its way for the common man and the millions of small businesses that power Asia's third largest economy.
Wearing a bright saffron turban and addressing crowds of spectators from the ramparts of Delhi's Red Fort during Independence Day celebrations, Modi also urged small shop owners and businesses to put up boards of ""Swadeshi"" or ""Made in India"" outside their stores.
""We should become self-reliant - not out of desperation, but out of pride,"" he said. ""Economic selfishness is on the rise globally and we mustn't sit and cry about our difficulties, we must rise above and not allow others to hold us in their clutches.""
He has since repeated these comments in at least two other public addresses this week. Modi's message to his countrymen has been loud and clear - both make in India and spend in India.
The former has proved increasingly difficult, with the share of manufacturing as part of India's gross domestic product (GDP) stagnating at 15% levels, despite his government rolling out subsidies and production incentives over the years.
But spurring long-pending tax reforms that immediately put more money into the hands of people could help the government soften some of the blow, experts say.
And so, after a $12bn income tax giveaway announced in the budget earlier this year, Modi is now aiming for an overhaul of India's indirect tax architecture – a reduction and simplification of the goods & service tax (GST).
GST, which was introduced eight years ago, replaced a maze of indirect taxes to reduce compliance and the cost of doing business.
But experts say it has too many thresholds and exemptions, making the system extremely complicated. They've repeatedly called for it to be revamped.
Now, Modi has promised precisely that, with India's finance ministry putting out a proposal for a simplified two-tier GST system.
""Combined with the income tax cut in place from April 2025... the GST rate reforms [likely worth US$20bn; £14.7bn] should together provide a meaningful push to consumption,"" analysts from Jeffries, a US brokerage house, said after the announcement.
Private consumption is a mainstay of India's economy, contributing to nearly 60% of the country's GDP. While rural spending – supported by a bumper harvest – has remained strong, demand for goods and services in cities has continued to slow down due to lower wages and job cuts in major sectors like IT, post the pandemic.
Modi's ""fiscal stimulus"" or tax cuts should help ensure a consumption recovery, according to investment banking firm Morgan Stanley. It will push GDP up and drag inflation down.
""This is particularly crucial amid headwinds from ongoing global geopolitical tensions and adverse global tariff-related developments that might impair external demand,"" Morgan Stanley said.
Among the sectors most likely to benefit from the tax breaks are consumer-facing ones such as, scooters, small cars, garments and even things like cement that goes into making homes, where demand typically picks up pace around Diwali.
While the specifics are unknown, most analysts estimate that the revenue loss on account of a lower GST would be offset by surplus collections of some taxes and higher than budgeted dividends from India's central bank.
According to Swiss investment bank UBS, the GST cuts will also have a larger ""multiplier effect"" than the previous corporate and income tax cuts undertaken by Modi, as they ""directly affect consumption at the point of purchase, potentially leading to higher consumer spending"".
Modi's tax handouts could also increase the probability of a further interest rate reduction by India's central bank, which has already slashed rates by 1% in the past few months - something that is likely to spur more lending, according to analysts.
This, along with a boost in the salaries of nearly five million government employees and 6.8 million pensioners that kicks in early next year, will help India's economy retain its growth momentum, they say.
India's stock markets have cheered these announcements. And despite the panic caused by trade uncertainties, earlier this month, India also got a rare sovereign rating upgrade from S&P Global, after a gap of 18 years. A sovereign rating measures how risky it is to lend to a government or invest in a country.
This is significant because it could lower the government's borrowing costs and improve foreign investment flows into the country.
But even as Modi rushes through with long-delayed reforms, India's growth prospects have slowed significantly from the 8% levels seen a few years ago, and its external crisis shows no sign of ebbing.
The war of words between Delhi and Washington, especially over the former's energy purchases from Russia, have only intensified and trade negotiations which were set to begin earlier this week, have been called off.
Meanwhile, at 50%, the tariffs on India are akin to a sanction on trade between the world's biggest and fastest growing economies, say experts - a scenario that would have been unthinkable even just a few months ago.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d061dv36lo,"How researchers recreated faces of 2,500-year-old skulls found in India
In a modest-sized university lab in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, researchers are using a tiny drill to scrape away enamel from a 2,500-year-old tooth.
Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University say the tooth belongs to one of two human skulls that they have used as models to digitally reconstruct faces to understand what the region's early inhabitants might have looked like.
The skulls, both belonging to men, were excavated from Kondagai, an ancient burial site about 4km (2.5 miles) from Keeladi - an archaeological site that has become a political flashpoint in India.
Tamil Nadu state department archaeologists say an urban civilisation dating back to 580BC existed in Keeladi, a claim that adds a new dimension to the story of the Indian subcontinent.
The Indus Valley Civilisation, that emerged over 5,000 years ago in the northern and central parts of present-day India, is the country's first major civilisation - and narratives around urbanisation have so far been confined to the north.
But state archaeologists say the findings at Keeladi indicate for the first time that an ancient independent civilisation existed in southern India as well.
They say the people of Keeladi were literate, highly-skilled and engaged in trade across the subcontinent and abroad. They lived in brick houses and buried their dead along with daily necessities like food grains and pots in massive burial urns in Kondagai.
Archaeologists have excavated about 50 such urns from the site so far.
Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University are now extracting DNA from human bones and other goods found in these urns to better understand who the inhabitants of Keeladi were and what their lifestyle was like.
But a more profound quest seems to be under way.
""We want to understand our ancestry and the migration routes of our ancestors,"" says professor G Kumaresan, who heads the genetics department at the university. ""It's a journey towards answering the larger question of 'who are we and how did we come to exist here',"" he adds.
- Ancient site stirs heated political debate on India's past
- Did Iron Age 'begin' in India? Tamil Nadu dig sparks debate
The exercise of reconstructing faces of the 2,500-year-old skulls has revealed clues that can answer at least one part of this question.
""The faces mainly have features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians - a population group believed to be the first inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent,"" says Prof Kumaresan.
The features also reveal traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiactic ancestries, hinting at global migration and the mixing of ancient population groups. But Prof Kumaresan says that more research is needed to properly establish the ancestries of Keeladi's residents.
The facial reconstruction of the skulls began with researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University creating 3D scans of the skulls.
These digital scans were then sent to Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK. Face Lab specialises in creating digital craniofacial reconstructions using forensic, artistic and scientific principles and technologies.
Experts at the lab used computer softwares to add muscles, flesh and skin to the scans of skulls, bringing out their facial features. These additions were made according to standard human anatomical proportions and measurements.
Then came the big challenge: adding colour to the images.
This brought up questions like which shade of brown should the men be, what colour should their eyes have and how should their hair look?
Prof Kumaresan says the standard practice of using colours that matched physical traits of people currently living in Tamil Nadu was followed, but the digital portraits still evoked lively discussions on social media.
They underscored longstanding divisions in Indian society - around race, culture and heritage.
Historical narratives championing Aryans (a term commonly used to describe people who settled in the northern part of India) as the ""original citizens"" of the country clashed with those that ascribed this title to Dravidians (a term used to describe people living primarily in India's southern states).
India has always been plagued by a north-south divide that stems partly from the popular belief that Indian civilisation - and everything associated with it, like language, culture and even religion - took root in the north and shaped the rest of the country.
But Prof Kumaresan says the facial portraits of the Keeladi skulls reveal a message that's more complex and inclusive.
""The message we can all take home is that we are more diverse than we realise, and the proof of this lies in our DNA,"" he says.
This isn't the first time that researchers in India have attempted to recreate faces from ancient skulls.
In 2019, scientists reconstructed faces of two skulls found at a cemetery in Rakhigarhi - an important Indus Valley Civilisation site in India. But the sketches lack colour and other physical traits.
""As humans, we have a fascination with faces – our ability to recognise and interpret faces is part of our success as a social species,"" says Caroline Wilkinson, who headed the Face Lab team that worked on the Keeladi men.
""These facial depictions also encourage the audience to understand ancient remains as people rather than artefacts, and to establish a connection through personal narrative rather than a wider population history,"" she adds.
At the Madurai Kamaraj University, efforts are under way to study Keeladi as thoroughly as the Indus Valley Civilisation.
""So far, we have learnt that the people of Keeladi were involved in agriculture, trade and cattle-rearing. They kept deer, goats and wild pigs and ate lots of rice and millets,"" says Prof Kumaresan.
""Interestingly, we have found evidence that they also consumed dates, even though the date palm isn't ubiquitous in Tamil Nadu at present,"" he adds.
But the most challenging task for his team remains extracting sufficient DNA from human skeletons found at Kondagai to create a gene library. Because the skeletons are badly degraded, the DNA extracted from them is low and of poor quality. But Prof Kumaresan is hopeful that some good will come out of these endeavours.
""Ancient DNA libraries are like portals to the past; they can reveal fascinating insights about life as it was and life as we know it to be,"" he says.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cvgv94qgnezo,"Unreachable to unplayable - how England had mixed opening day
- Published
At the start of the 40th over - after two long rain delays, with cloudy skies and a green pitch at his disposal - Josh Tongue had the in-form Ravindra Jadeja in his sights.
The first ball of the over flew past wicketkeeper Jamie Smith for four byes. The second was short, wide and flashed for four. The third was a beauty on a good length, nibbling away from the left-hander and taking the edge.
From unreachable to unplayable, bizarre to brilliant.
Three balls that encapsulated England in their entirety, as they restricted India to 204-6 on day one of the fifth Test at The Oval.
Neither Tongue, nor India's batters, seemed to know what was coming next, as the sheepish giggle after Jadeja's wicket suggested.
Four overs previously, a similar delivery accounted for Sai Sudharsan after a gritty 107-ball 38, while he had started the day with a nine-ball over that conceded 11 runs from wides.
""Tongue looked like the bowler I would least like to face,"" former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special.
""You'd have no chance of lining him up - he was wide down the leg side, wide down the off side, half-volley, bouncer and then all of a sudden right in the perfect zone.""
Tongue was not the sole bowler guilty of inconsistency, though that was probably to be expected with England's depleted stock of quicks.
Already without captain Ben Stokes through a shoulder injury and Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse for rotation reasons, late in the day their fortunes went from bad to worse.
Chris Woakes, 14 overs into his legs and playing his fifth consecutive Test, sprawled over the boundary rope to try and save a four and immediately clutched his shoulder in agony and is unlikely to play a part in the rest of the match.
Gus Atkinson was impressive on his return from a hamstring problem, with figures of 2-31 from his 19 overs, but England must be wary of over-working him, with Stokes as a case study.
Tongue and Jamie Overton - playing just his second Test, three years after his first - offered little in terms of control and Joe Root and Jacob Bethell are part-time spin options. It is fair to say that stand-in skipper Ollie Pope has a headache.
India fail to punish England's 'liquorice all sorts'
Despite England's wayward day, however, India were unable to assert their dominance when they are in need of a win to avoid a series defeat.
England bowled 20% of their deliveries down the leg side and attacked the stumps with just 12% - the second-lowest for any innings in the series. But, at the same time, they drew 24% false shots from India, the highest for day one throughout this series.
But considering they were faced with tricky batting conditions, Tongue's erratic spell at one end and Atkinson's economic efforts at the other, perhaps it is of little surprise that India's minds were somewhat scrambled.
""Tongue made India do things they don't want to do,"" former England batter Sir Alastair Cook told BBC Test Match Special.
""He has bowled a couple of absolute jaffas, but liquorice all sorts is what we used to call them when you're bowling like that. When you face someone who's so inconsistent, you feel you've got to be scoring.
""You think there's plenty of opportunities to score, but because it could be anywhere it really upsets your rhythm. It's that mental thing, knowing he's not bowling well so I should be going after him and he drags you into shots.""
India's stubborn pair of Karun Nair and Washington Sundar led them out of a pickle from 153-6, playing with assured control that the rest of the top order had been lacking.
It was a curious day with neither side able to seize momentum for significant periods, but there is a sense that England missed their opportunity considering the conditions and India's loose dismissals.
""England, if they're being brutally honest with themselves - on a pitch that they've bowled on today with 8mm of grass - there's been enough seam movement and swing that they would've fancied bowling India out today,"" Vaughan added.
""They'll be thinking, if two of us bowled like Gus Atkinson then we'd have bowled them out.""

Kate Cross has been left out of England's squad for the Women's World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, but batter Danni Wyatt-Hodge and leg-spinner Sarah Glenn have been recalled.
Former captain Heather Knight, who has been recovering from a hamstring injury since the end of May, is also included.
Seamer Cross is one of England's most experienced bowlers in one-day internationals, with 101 wickets in 76 matches, but she has struggled for form since suffering a back injury at the end of 2024.
The 33-year-old was injured during England's tour of South Africa in December, and was subsequently included in the Ashes squad but did not play a game during the disastrous 16-0 thrashing in Australia.
Cross has played four ODIs this summer, three against West Indies and one against India, but only took three wickets at an average of 55.
The World Cup starts on 30 September, with England's first match against South Africa taking place on 3 October in Bengaluru.
Australia are defending their title after they beat England in the 2022 final.
England squad for the ICC Women's World Cup: Em Arlott, Tammy Beaumont, Lauren Bell, Alice Capsey, Charlie Dean, Sophia Dunkley, Sophie Ecclestone, Lauren Filer, Sarah Glenn, Amy Jones, Heather Knight, Emma Lamb, Nat Sciver-Brunt (captain), Linsey Smith, Danni Wyatt-Hodge.
- Published16 August
- Published14 August
It has been a tumultuous year for England, who were knocked out of the T20 World Cup last November by West Indies before the Ashes defeat led to a complete overhaul with Nat Sciver-Brunt replacing Knight as captain, and former skipper Charlotte Edwards taking over as coach from Jon Lewis.
Edwards' era started with a clean sweep over a poor West Indies side but weaknesses were exposed against a strong India who won both the T20 and ODI series.
But this is her first major assignment, with England underdogs going into the tournament, where co-hosts India and serial winners Australia are the favourites.
Wyatt-Hodge provides more experience in the batting line-up after she missed out on both series this summer, while Knight's return is a significant boost to a struggling middle order.
Edwards told the BBC Stumped podcast that she expects Sciver-Brunt to bowl during the World Cup after her recovery from an Achilles problem, which helps balance the side with an extra batter.
Glenn forms a strong and varied spin attack with left-armers Sophie Ecclestone and Linsey Smith alongside off-spinner Charlie Dean, while Alice Capsey offers another part-time option on surfaces expected to favour slow bowling.
Lauren Bell leads the seam attack alongside Em Arlott, who made her debut this summer, and Lauren Filer provides extra pace.
""Like all global tournaments, it will be a huge challenge but we want to go as far as we possibly can in India and I believe that if we play our best cricket we can compete with anyone,"" Edwards said.
""Conditions mean we have gone for the extra spinner and we're lucky to be able to have such depth in this department.
""It's great to have Danni back in the squad. She's been in good form in domestic cricket and she'll bring dynamism and depth to our batting, alongside Heather, who we are absolutely delighted to be able to select. She'll be a huge asset for us.
""India and Sri Lanka are amazing places to play cricket, and as a group we have a huge opportunity to go and do something special."""

Banning tobacco didn't stop smoking, but banning cigarette vending machines meaningfully reduced it, especially in under-age smokers and lighter smokers.
In the US, smoking has decreased dramatically in the last 50 years, from about one out of three adults smoking to closer to one of out ten. This hasn't been done with an outright ban on smoking. Rather, it's been a combination of high cigarette taxes, banning smoking in almost all public areas as well as many private areas, and public ad campaigns that transformed smoking from cool to not cool.

- Published
England may lack the killer instinct needed to win in this winter's Ashes, says former Australia head coach Justin Langer.
Langer, 54, won four Ashes series as a player and was unbeaten in two series as a coach before leaving in 2022.
England played their part in a thrilling 2-2 draw with India this summer and also drew the last series with Australia in the UK 2-2 in 2023.
Speaking to Stuart Broad and Jos Buttler on BBC Sounds' For the Love of Cricket podcast, Langer said: ""It's going to be a really, really close series. My question for England will be, have you got the killer instinct to finish off a series if you get a chance?
""We've seen it, the two-all here in the last Ashes series, two-all against India.
""England had the chances to win that series. Have you got the killer instinct to win the Ashes in Australia? That's going to be the big question.""
England have only won one Ashes series in Australia since 1987, a 3-1 series win in 2010-11.
Their past three tours have been lost without winning a match and Langer thinks the tourists will have to be aggressive to stand a chance on the tour which starts with the first Test in Perth on 21 November.
""Call it Bazball or the aggressive approach, I think England must play that approach in Australia. No question, because it'll put pressure back on,"" he said.
""The only players who had success against Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath were those who attacked them. They got back in their face and they hated it because no one did it.
""It's going to take courage because you have got Mitchell Starc bowling like he does, Josh Hazlewood never misses the spot and Pat Cummins is a generational bowler. So it's going to take great courage.""
'Latest Australian barb in phoney war'
Analysis by BBC Sport's Matthew Henry
Langer is the latest Australian to cast doubt on England's hopes in the Ashes this winter. The phoney war is well under way.
First Steve Smith said their batters would struggle because of the pitches down under, then David Warner's comments about Joe Root and his surfboard pads, and now Langer has questioned England's mindset.
Given the chance, England fans would likely remind Langer it was Australia who were 2-0 up in the 2023 Ashes but could not complete the job. Had the rain not intervened in Manchester, England would have been the first team to come from 2-0 down to win an Ashes series.
Still, there is something in his comments that will linger. Fresh in the memory is the fifth Test against India, where England were cruising towards a victory and a 3-1 series win only to collapse.
Remember the 4-1 defeat in India in early 2024 too? After winning the series opener in Hyderabad, England had their chances in the subsequent Tests but lost all four.
Ultimately, the uncertainty is what makes this winter appear so intriguing.
Men's Ashes 2025-26 schedule
First Test, Optus Stadium in Perth: 21-25 November
Second Test, Gabba in Brisbane: 4-8 December
Third Test, Adelaide Oval in Adelaide: 17-21 December

When Capt Yavar Abbas stood on stage in front of King Charles III and Queen Camilla on Friday, he wasn't expecting to make headlines.
He was at the official commemoration for the 80th anniversary of VJ - Victory over Japan - Day in Staffordshire as one of the last remaining veterans. Yavar was about to give a short address about his experience on the Asian front. But he decided to go off script.
He told the audience he wished ""to salute my brave King who is here with his beloved Queen in spite of the fact that he's under treatment for cancer"".
The King and Queen became visibly emotional. Yavar went on to tell the crowd he had been free of cancer too for the past 25 years, receiving a round of applause.
Yavar is 104, and his journey to this moment, which he told to me when I met him earlier this year, is extraordinary.
He was born in Charkhari in British India, in what he describes as a ""one-horse town"". Officially his birth date is registered in 1921, but Yavar says he was born on 15 December 1920. He was a student when Britain declared war on Nazi Germany on behalf of India in 1939.
From early December 1941, there was a new enemy and a new front. Japan had attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor. Hours later, Japanese forces targeted British colonies in South East Asia. And in just a few months, Japan had taken territory that had been part of the British Empire for more than a century, including Malaya (now Malaysia), Singapore and Burma (now Myanmar).
By mid-1942 Yavar had to make an important decision - fight for the British or for Indian independence. He could not believe how quickly parts of the British Empire had fallen to Japan. There was a palpable fear that India could be next.
""I was not a supporter of British imperialism, in fact I detested it,"" Yavar tells me. At the time, there was a growing pro-independence movement calling for the British to ""Quit India,"" which was brutally suppressed.
Yavar was aware fighting for the British would mean fighting a war in the name of freedom - while Indians were not free from colonial rule. But, like many Indian nationalists, he did not want Nazism and fascism to prevail.
""I had to choose and hope that if I joined the [British Indian] army, after the war, as they had been promising, I would get independence.""
So Yavar enlisted - and became one of around 2.5 million Indian soldiers to sign up. Initially he joined the 11th Sikh regiment and was posted to a ""God-forsaken place"" in a remote part of East Bengal, where he spent his days guarding a strategic site - and felt disappointed at the lack of action.
Attitudes among the British officers frustrated him too.
""I found myself in a version of Dad's Army, in the company of white, middle-aged men as my fellow officers, who still considered India to be a crown colony on which they'll have continuing control for the foreseeable future.""
One day in the mess, Yavar spotted an advert in The Army Gazette for officers to be trained as combat cameramen. He applied and was soon accepted.
In this role he joined the newly formed British 14th Army, whose aim was to win back territory lost to Japan. The troops of this army were well-trained for jungle warfare, and had better equipment. A multi-national force, in time it would number up to a million soldiers - mostly Indian, but also from other parts of the British Empire - including West and East Africa.
This army felt completely different to Yavar: ""It was wonderful camaraderie. There were British and Indians mixing with each other.""
Yavar would go on to film on the front lines at many major Allied-Japanese battles of the Burma campaign from 1944. He would travel in his jeep with an assistant, armed with a pistol and a Vinten film camera, a tripod, and many rolls of film. He sent his rushes to Calcutta (now Kolkata), along with dope sheets explaining what the shots were. There they were edited, and the film distributed for propaganda or newsreels.
Yavar was at the siege of Imphal and the battle of Kohima when Japan invaded the strategic north-eastern Indian towns. Japan's aim was to cut off the Allied supply line to China. Repelling Japanese forces at Imphal and Kohima was hugely significant, because success in taking these towns could allow Japan to progress deeper into India and expand its empire.
These battles have been described by some historians as among the most significant of World War Two. British, Gurkha, Indian and African troops decisively halted the offensive into India. Tens of thousands of Japanese forces died. Many killed themselves rather than being taken prisoner in defeat.
Yavar cannot forget the aftermath of the battles. ""It was a horrible sight, Japanese with swords sticking out of their bodies, instead of falling into enemy hands."" The British advance to re-take Burma began afterwards.
Yavar was around 30 miles (50km) from Mandalay when he had a brush with death. He tells me how the Japanese put up stiff resistance, and the Allies couldn't advance, so they took cover in shallow trenches. He was in one with a Gurkha unit, but continued to film. He thinks a sniper saw his camera and shot towards him. The Gurkha beside him was hit in the temple and died. Yavar's camera shattered.
""I'm lucky to be alive,"" he says.
The Battle of Mandalay was a crucial one for the Allies. If they managed to take it, the road to the capital Rangoon (now Yangon), would be open to them. Yavar was in a tank, and decided he needed a better shot of the action. ""I just climbed up on top of the trunk and started filming.""
The turret opened and he was told by another officer to get down for his own safety. ""It was a stupid thing to do, but that's the kind of thing you do when you're young.""
The gun battle was intense and the aim was to capture the Japanese stronghold of Fort Dufferin. Yavar filmed the enemy positions being bombed relentlessly from the air.
""They kept on pounding them, pounding them, pounding them,"" he recalls.
I went to the Imperial War Museum in London and found the footage that Yavar filmed that day. Even without sound, the raw, unedited, black and white images are as dramatic as Yavar described. I returned to his home to show him the footage which he had never seen.
As he watched it, the events from 80 years all come back and he points at the screen as he remembers.
""That's my shot,"" he tells me as the British flag is raised in victory over the strategic Fort Dufferin.
He shakes his head watching the images. ""It's bizarre to be sitting here and watching all that, and to think that I was in the middle of that.""
He says he cannot believe now that 80 years ago he was happy to shoot Japanese forces with his camera, as well as his gun.
""I'm not very proud of that,"" Yavar says, ""but that's how you feel when you are on the front.""
Yavar has something to show me, that he had found that morning. He takes out a faded notepad with loose leaves of paper that have yellowed with age. It's his diary from the front line. He had carried an ink pot with him in battle and written in the diary with his fountain pen. He reads out an entry from the day that Fort Dufferin fell on 20 March 1945.
""Thank goodness it is all over and that I'm still alive. I can still hear the noise of shelling not far away. Maybe it is the Japanese guns firing at the Fort. I'll find out tomorrow. Two o'clock in the morning now, and I must go to sleep.""
Yavar wonders aloud how in the midst of battle he found time to sit and write this when he had to be up again at five in the morning.
I ask him if he thinks he is brave. He looks at me as if that is a strange question. ""Absolutely not,"" he says.
On VE Day, 8 May 1945 - when the war ended in Europe - Yavar was in Rangoon filming the recently re-taken capital. However, it was so inconsequential he didn't note it in his diary. Little had changed for him.
The war against Japan was still ongoing. But then, completely unexpectedly months later, America dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan unconditionally surrendered on 15 August 1945, the day that VJ Day is marked each year.
After the war, Yavar was posted with the 268 Indian Brigade as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces under the overall command of US Gen Douglas McArthur. He went to Hiroshima months after the bombing.
Yavar says he saw the wasteland and people with horrific injuries.
""There were no buildings, it was just one tower that was left. Otherwise the whole thing was flat.""
It's the first time since we have spoken that Yavar's bearing changes - he has a look of horror as he remembers.
""It still haunts me,"" he says. ""I couldn't believe that human beings could do this to each other. Hiroshima was a terrible experience.""
The British did leave India, as Yavar had hoped. In August 1947, India was partitioned and two new states were born: Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.
Yavar was a witness to the bloody aftermath, and was heartbroken at the decision to divide India. Two years later, he came to Britain.
He worked for many years at the BBC as a news cameraman travelling the world. He would go on to be an acclaimed independent film-maker, winning numerous awards.
VJ Day - on 15 August - is not a day Yavar ever celebrates. Current events weigh heavily on him. Yavar's message, as one of the last remaining survivors of World War Two, is clear.
""War is a crime. War must be banned. I think it's mad. We didn't achieve anything really.""
He says at the time he felt he was part of something worthwhile, for the sake of humanity - he doesn't feel that now.
The wars engulfing the world 80 years on - particularly Gaza - are on his mind.
""We seem to have learnt nothing,"" Yavar tells me. ""The killing of innocent men, women, children, and even babies goes on. And the world, with some honourable exceptions, watches in silence...
""It was all futile, because it's still happening. We haven't learned anything at all."""
https://www.businessinsider.com/moved-tokyo-bengaluru-japan-india-vc-family-2025-8,"- Shun Sagara moved from Tokyo to Bengaluru in 2023 to expand his Japanese VC firm.
- Sagara aims to invest in Indian startups with potential for global leadership and collaboration.
- He said that he and his wife love raising children in India because of the hospitality.
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shun Sagara, a venture capitalist who moved from Tokyo to Bengaluru with his family in 2023. It has been edited for length and clarity.
I grew up in Japan and began my career at an enterprise software company in Tokyo. I spent five years at the company in various sales roles before I left in 2018. The following year, I joined my current venture capital firm, Genesia Ventures, and worked as an investment manager.
In my second year at the firm, there was serious interest in international expansion. We had a presence in Southeast Asia, and there was a growing consensus that India was our next logical destination. It aligned perfectly with my ambition to work in a fast-paced market, and I was keen to make a move.
My move to India wasn't driven by a fascination with curry or Bollywood or anything like that. I always felt like India and Japan shine on the sidelines but don't claim the center stage the way China or the US do. The trigger moment for me was when a Japanese founder told me I was the only VC among 20 to 30 meetings she had taken who truly understood enterprise businesses. It was flattering but rang alarm bells — if there was no competition around me, then maybe I was playing in the wrong league. Moving to India, where startups are not just building products, but are building the infrastructure of a rising economic power, felt like the next best step for me.
Moving with family wasn't an easy decision. My wife was a flight attendant for Japanese Airlines and had been exposed to New Delhi, the capital, before. She didn't like the air quality, the spicy food, and how it wasn't safe for young single women. I had to convince her that Bengaluru was different from Delhi. Once she was on board, we moved to Bengaluru in the summer of 2023 so I could launch an India subsidiary for my VC firm.
Being a VC in India
I'm the company's only employee in the country, and I'm tasked with making India investments for our Japan-based fund. Our average first check size is around $500,000, and we top it up with $1 million to $1.5 million investments.
My investment thesis is based on these three qualities rather than specific sectors: founders who understand the Indian context well; areas such as pharmaceuticals or precision manufacturing where Indian companies can become global market leaders; and areas where there is opportunity for India-Japan collaborations, like elder care or workforce shortage problems. Since launching our India office, I have invested in five companies.
There are big differences in how business is done. For example, Japanese culture is built around risk mitigation, while the Indian startup ecosystem is not. In Japan, our startup pitch decks have 40-50 slides and address every single objection a VC may have. In India, founders walk into meetings with a napkin sketch and unshakeable conviction. Both approaches work from my experience.
Another key difference is India's ""jugaad"" mentality, which is all about improvising with what you have, versus the Japanese ""kaizen,"" which involves continuous optimization of existing processes. I've found that combining these mindsets in India-Japanese deals can produce extraordinary results.
Raising a family in India
Coming from Japan, cleanliness is one of the biggest differences about living in India, and it is also one thing my wife and children find challenging.
But when it comes to raising children, India, and in particular Bengaluru, is one of the best cities in the world. People are warm and kind toward foreigners, and most people love children. My two little kids — a five-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son — are well-treated by local people. There are also great international schools in the city, and raising children has been a great experience for my wife and me.
What surprised me most was the grassroots popularity of sports. I always knew that India was a cricket-loving country, but I was shocked to see how popular soccer is getting in the country. Two years into living here, I have a weekly soccer game with five friends. While I know lots of Japanese expats and other foreigners, 90% of my circle is local Indians.
The people I work with are collaborative and open-minded, and they have always been helpful when I encounter daily operational challenges.
My commitment to living in India is long term, and I don't plan to come back to Japan in the next five years at least. Even if I move back home after 10 years, I want to continue to be exposed to India and Indian businesses. Bridging India and Japan is the goal of my entire life and career.

HANSALPUR, India (Reuters) -Japan's Suzuki Motor will invest 700 billion rupees ($8 billion) in India over the next five to six years, its chairman said on Tuesday, as production of the automaker's first electric vehicle began.
Through its majority stake in Maruti Suzuki, Suzuki Motors already produces 17 models in India for export to around 100 countries, including back to Japan. It will now also become the global production hub for the company's electric cars.
Shares of Maruti Suzuki rose 2.6% to an all-time high after the investment was announced during an event to mark the start of commercial production of the mid-sized ""e Vitara"" SUV at its Gujarat plant in the village of Hansalpur Becharaji.
Maruti will export between 50,000 and 100,000 of the EVs a year, its chairman RC Bhargava said. He added that there was not yet a timeline for a launch in India, the world's third-largest car market in which Suzuki commands a leading 40% share, in part due to the high cost of batteries that would push up costs for price-conscious local consumers.
The e Vitara will compete with Hyundai's Creta and Mahindra's XEV 9e.
Suzuki Motor earlier this year trimmed its sales target in India, its biggest market by sales and revenue, and also scaled back its electric vehicle plans amid intensifying competition in the South Asian nation and a global slowdown in EV sales.
EV sales growth in India is still outpacing the overall car market and electric models account for about 4.5% of all cars sold in the current fiscal year from April 1. The government is maintaining a target of a 30% share by 2030.
The Gujarat plant is set to become one of the world's largest automobile manufacturing hubs, with a planned capacity of 1 million units, said Suzuki Motor chairman and president Toshihiro Suzuki.
It is surrounded by low-lying industrial units housing suppliers to Suzuki and other companies in the area.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who attended Tuesday's event and plans to visit Japan next week, said the plant, including the e Vitara, was a ""big leap"" towards the government's 'Make in India' goal.
He again urged people to buy local products, saying that included anything made on Indian soil, irrespective of where the investment came from, including Maruti's cars.

By Kanishka Singh
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government noted abuses in India and Pakistan in a shortened human rights report released on Tuesday that said India ""took minimal credible steps"" to combat the abuses while Pakistan ""rarely took credible steps.""
The Trump administration scaled back the annual U.S. government report on human rights worldwide, dramatically softening criticism of some allies and countries that have been President Donald Trump's partners.
The State Department human rights documentation for India and Pakistan was also much shorter and scaled back this year.
India has been an important U.S. partner in recent years in Washington's effort to counter China's rise, although relations have been tense over Trump's imposition of a 50% tariff on goods from India. Pakistan is a non-NATO U.S. ally.
About India, the report said: ""The government took minimal credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.""
On Pakistan, it added: ""The government rarely took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.""
Indian and Pakistani embassies in Washington had no immediate comment on the report released on Tuesday, which documented instances in 2024.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch fault Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government for its treatment of minorities.
They point to rising hate speeches, a religion-based citizenship law the U.N. calls ""fundamentally discriminatory,"" anti-conversion legislation that challenges freedom of belief, the 2019 removal of Muslim-majority Kashmir's special status, and the demolition of properties owned by Muslims.
Modi denies discrimination and says his policies, such as food subsidy programs and electrification drives, benefit everyone.
In Pakistan, Amnesty International says government authorities fail to protect minorities, including Christians, and use ""excessive and unnecessary force"" against civil society voices and protesters.
In particular, rights groups, the U.N., and Western governments raised concerns over the 2024 Pakistani elections. A U.N. working group said last year that former Prime Minister Imran Khan's detention violated international law. Khan remains in jail.
Islamabad says its elections were fair and dismisses allegations of rigging and foul play.
Washington and New Delhi have not reached a trade deal, while the United States has reached an agreement in recent weeks with Pakistan.
Trump angered India by taking credit for an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May after hostilities between the neighbors following an April attack in India-administered Kashmir. India says New Delhi and Islamabad should resolve their ties directly without outside involvement.

https://gizmodo.com/why-pooping-on-planes-might-actually-be-a-good-thing-2000644946,"Researchers have developed a new critical warning system for the spread of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) superbugs: poop and pee from airplane bathrooms.
Scientists predict that by 2050, AMR superbugs, or pathogens that don’t respond to antimicrobial medicines, might take more lives than cancer. As such, it’s critical for countries to keep an eye on the global propagation of these dangerous pathogens, which can travel with people, in order to best prepare for future infections. In a study published in May in the journal Microbiology Spectrum, a team of international researchers suggests that aircraft toilet wastewater could warn authorities about the arrival of such superbugs.
“Long-haul flight aircraft wastewater may serve as a representative microbial footprint, often of mixed country origin, offering valuable insight into the movement of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) on a global scale,” the team wrote in the study. “Herein, we present a proof-of-concept for aircraft-based surveillance of AMR by investigating lavatory wastewater samples from 44 repatriation flights to Australia departing from nine countries.”
What did researchers find in airplane toilet wastewater?
The analysis revealed nine dangerous pathogens, including some superbugs that are resistant to more than one drug. The team investigated the superbugs’ genetic signatures and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles, finding a gene that lends resistance to last-resort antibiotics on 17 flights. Interestingly, this dangerous gene was not present in Australia’s urban wastewater at the time, indicating its arrival via international travel. All 44 flight samples had five out of the nine superbugs.
“Aircraft wastewater captures microbial signatures from passengers across different continents, offering a non-invasive, cost-effective way to monitor threats like AMR,” Warish Ahmed, a senior author of the study and researcher from CSIRO, said in a University of South Australia statement.
Eighteen of the flights came from India, 14 from the United Kingdom, six from Germany, and one each from France, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, South Africa, Japan, and Indonesia. According to Nicholas Ashbolt, a co-author of the study and a microbiologist at the University of South Australia, flights from Asia, especially from India, revealed greater concentrations of antibiotic-resistance genes than those from Europe and the United Kingdom. These distinctions could be due to differences in antibiotic use, water sanitation, population density, and public health policies.
“International travel is one of the major drivers of AMR spread,” said Yawen Liu, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow at Xiamen University. “By monitoring aircraft wastewater, we can potentially detect and track antibiotic resistance genes before they become established in local environments.” Tuberculosis, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2, for example, can also spread by air travel.
Wastewater could provide a warning system for superbugs
While the researchers collected the wastewater samples from Covid-19 pandemic repatriation flights, potentially swaying passenger demographics, they argue that similar methods can also work for regular international travel.
“With AMR projected to cause more than 39 million deaths globally by 2050, the need for innovative surveillance tools is urgent,” Ashbolt concluded. “Aircraft wastewater monitoring could complement existing public health systems, providing early warnings of emerging superbug threats.”"
https://gizmodo.com/fda-warns-public-not-to-eat-frozen-shrimp-that-could-be-radioactive-2000645121,"Food recalls and warnings happen every day. But the latest warning from the Food and Drug Administration about frozen shrimp is an odd one. That’s because the health agency is concerned about possible radioactive contamination.
The FDA issued an alert on Tuesday for some Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp sold at Walmart. The shrimp was processed by PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati of Indonesia, also known as BMS Foods, and flagged by Customs and Border Protection at four different ports of entry.
The FDA explains that it hasn’t found shrimp on store shelves that have tested positive for radioactive contamination, but is concerned the food “may have become contaminated with Cs-137” because it “appears to have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions.” The FDA reportedly found Cs-137 in a single shipment of shrimp that obviously wasn’t allowed to be sent to stores.
The amount of Cs-137 found in the shrimp was 68 Bq/kg, which is below the standard for federal intervention, which sits at 1200 Bq/kg. Cs-137 is a radioisotope of cesium that is not naturally occurring and comes from nuclear explosions that started to contaminate Earth’s atmosphere since the first tests of 1945.
Trace amounts of Cs-137 can now be found in the environment, and the FDA explained in its alert that it was concerned about the kind of exposure the shrimp had while being prepared and packaged.
The shrimp lots that are being recalled:
- Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, lot code: 8005540-1, Best by Date: 3/15/2027
- Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, lot code: 8005538-1, Best by Date: 3/15/2027
- Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, lot code: 8005539-1, Best by Date: 3/15/2027
Consumers are being told to dispose of any shrimp they find with those lot codes.
“FDA has also added PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati to a new import alert for chemical contamination to stop products from this firm from coming into the U.S. until the firm has resolved the conditions that gave rise to the appearance of the violation,” the health agency said.
The U.S. shrimp industry has long complained about foreign shrimp undercutting prices for the domestic product, and the Southern Shrimp Alliance has been highlighting what it calls “disturbing reasons” the FDA must crack down on shrimp imported from Indonesia. The group pointed to a health alert from Aug. 14 over concerns about unsanitary conditions.
The Southern Shrimp Alliance has welcomed President Donald Trump’s tariffs on shrimp from Asia, which are pretty much guaranteed to raise prices for consumers but will give local shrimpers a better shot at staying competitive. Trump has threatened a 50% tariff on India, which is likely to drive many shrimp companies in that country to either go out of business or look for other markets. India already faces a 25% tariff, and another 25% is scheduled to be tacked on Aug. 27 to hurt the country over its purchase of Russian oil, according to Reuters.
BMS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Gizmodo will update this article if we hear back."
https://www.businessinsider.com/air-india-suspending-delhi-washington-us-route-pakistan-airspace-closure-2025-8,"- Air India said it's suspending flights between Delhi and Washington, DC, from September 1.
- It cited a retrofit program as well as the closure of Pakistan's airspace to Indian carriers.
- The airspace closure means flights have stopped in Austria to refuel and are hours longer.
Air India is stopping one of its routes to the US, citing fewer available planes and longer flights caused by the monthslong partial closure of Pakistan's airspace.
The flag carrier announced Monday that it plans to suspend flights between Delhi and Washington, DC, starting September 1.
Since it was taken over by the Tata Group in 2022, Air India has undergone an ambitious transformation to expand and modernize. That includes upgrading planes with newer seats.
Last month, it began retrofitting 26 of its Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which means several of them will be undergoing work at any given time until the end of next year.
The airline has also faced difficulties with some of its routes since Pakistan closed its airspace to Indian carriers in late April, following regional conflict between the two countries.
In Monday's announcement, it said this has resulted in ""longer flight routings and increased operational complexity.""
Because some of its US routes already stretched the limits of their planes' maximum ranges, flying around Pakistan has required fuel stops.
The Delhi-to-DC route, Flight 103, could previously fly directly north and over the Arctic Circle — but it has stopped to refuel in Vienna since April.
That means what was once a roughly 15-hour flight now takes about 19 hours, including around 60 minutes on the ground in the Austrian capital.
Air India said passengers who have already booked journeys between Delhi and Washington, DC, from September 1 would be offered a choice between rebooking on another flight or a full refund.
The airline said it will still fly to four US airports: New York JFK, Newark, Chicago O'Hare, and San Francisco.
Interline agreements with Alaska Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines mean passengers could get a connecting flight to Washington, DC, on the same ticket.
However, all of these journeys now take longer since Air India has to fly around its neighboring country to reach the US.
For example, Flight 101, from Delhi to JFK, takes about 16 hours — two hours longer than before the airspace closure.
This route also made fuel stops in Europe for a few weeks, but has flown direct since mid-May."
https://www.theverge.com/news/719929/apple-100-billion-investment-us-manufacturing-trump,"Apple is putting another $100 billion toward expanding manufacturing in the US as the company responds to pressure from President Donald Trump to manufacture more of its products in the US. The move builds upon the company’s initial plan to invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years, and includes a new American Manufacturing Program that the company says will bring more of Apple’s “supply chain and advanced manufacturing” to the US.
Apple announces $100 billion US manufacturing plan after pressure from Donald Trump
Apple is trying to stave off Trump’s tariff threat by bringing iPhone and Watch cover glass production to the US.
Apple is trying to stave off Trump’s tariff threat by bringing iPhone and Watch cover glass production to the US.
As part of its investment, Apple has agreed to an expanded partnership with Corning to manufacture “100 percent” of the iPhone and Apple Watch cover glass in Kentucky. It will also work with Samsung at its chip fab in Austin, Texas, “to launch an innovative new technology for making chips, which has never been used before anywhere in the world,” according to Apple’s press release.
Apple’s Houston-based server factory, which it announced earlier this year, will begin mass production starting in 2026, while Apple is also expanding its data center in Maiden, North Carolina. Last month, Apple announced that it will open a manufacturing academy in Michigan to help train American companies in “advanced manufacturing” techniques as well.
It’s not clear whether Apple’s new promises will satiate Trump, who believes Apple can make its iPhones in the US. Apple has shifted some of its manufacturing out of China and into Vietnam and India in recent years in an attempt to avoid tariffs and supply chain disruptions. Trump has criticized Apple for not bringing the work back to the US instead, and threatened the company with a 25 percent tariff if it doesn’t manufacture more products domestically.
During Trump’s first term, Apple CEO Tim Cook similarly tried to curry favor with the administration by holding private dinners and even lobbying the US trade representative for lighter tariffs. The company even announced plans to manufacture its 2019 Mac Pro in Texas after Trump granted Apple a tariff exemption. At the time, reports suggested that Apple planned to manufacture its Mac Pro in China after the US production of its 2013 model was hobbled by a screw shortage.
“I’m proud to say that Apple is leading the creation of an end-to-end silicon supply chain right here in America, from design to equipment to wafer production to fabrication to packaging,” Cook said during a press briefing. “We’re going to keep working with our suppliers to move even more of this incredibly advanced work to America.”
Apple revealed last week that Trump’s tariffs could add another $1.1 billion to its costs during the September quarter, adding to the $800 million it has already spent on the levies. Trump has also introduced new “reciprocal” tariffs that affect products imported from a wide range of countries, including Vietnam, which manufactures Macs, iPads, and Watches. On Wednesday, Trump said he would raise tariffs on India by 25 percent, where Cook said the “majority” of iPhones destined for the US are made.
Update, August 6th: Added a statement from Cook.

https://www.cnet.com/tech/apple-is-making-all-four-iphone-17-models-in-india-in-a-big-pivot-from-china-report-says/,"Apple is manufacturing all four of its iPhone 17 models in India ahead of next month's launch, according to Bloomberg. That marks a first for the company, as it tries to mitigate the effects of President Donald Trump's tariffs on products produced in China.
The production is taking place at five Indian factories. Tata Group is managing half of the manufacturing in new plants in the southern state Tamil Nadu and Taiwan's Foxconn will be manufacturing iPhones near the Bangalore airport.
Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Apple will launch its four iPhone 17 models sometime in September (check out all the rumored iPhone 17 features) in what may be the last iteration of the company's typical late-summer product launches. Apple reportedly will begin two-phase rollouts in 2026.
India has become the No. 1 maker of smartphones shipped to the US, and its iPhone production there jumped 63% (to $7.5 billion in exports) in the second quarter of 2025 as Apple has maneuvered through the new landscape of US tariffs.
Sanyam Chaurasia, principal analyst at Omdia, called it ""a watershed moment"" in global smartphone manufacturing. He noted that the increasing production in India has been focused on mature phone models and those intended for export.
""China will remain central for Apple's flagship innovation and base models. However, the trend is clear: The center of gravity in iPhone production is tilting toward a multicountry model,"" Chaurasia said.
Early this year, CEO Tim Cook said that Apple would be moving nearly all of its assembly of US-bound iPhones to India to avoid tariff penalties. Chaurasia said there was a 27% increase in US-bound iPhones made in India from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025.
However, China will still be the top producer (by far) of iPhones to non-US markets.
""Apple isn't abandoning China, but it is de-risking by building parallel supply chains, and India has emerged as the most critical alternative,"" said Chaurasia."
https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-economy-oil-gas-energy-revenue-war-funding-india-trump-2025-8,"- Russia's oil and gas revenues — a key source of war funding — fell 27% in July.
- EU sanctions and flexible price caps are cutting into Moscow's energy income.
- Trump is targeting India with tariffs over Russian oil imports. Delhi may use this to seek trade relief.
Russia's revenue from oil and gas has plunged recently, putting further pressure on Moscow to end its war in Ukraine.
In July, Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration collected 787.3 billion rubles, or $9.8 billion, from oil and gas revenue — 27% lower than a year ago, according to the country's finance ministry on Tuesday.
The decline in energy tax revenue further strains Russia's budget, which posted a deficit of 3.7 trillion rubles, or 1.7% of GDP, in the first half of the year. Oil and gas remain vital to Russia's economy and to funding its war, now in its fourth year.
That funding is now under threat on multiple fronts.
Last month, the European Union unveiled its 18th sanctions package against Russia. It replaced the fixed $60-per-barrel cap on Russian oil with a more flexible mechanism that limits prices to 15% below global market averages, effectively slashing Moscow's revenue on each exported barrel.
But the pressure isn't just coming from Europe.
Trump targets India over Russian oil
Recently, Trump has sharpened his rhetoric — and trade threats — against countries buying Russian oil, singling out India, a top buyer of the fuel.
Last week, Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods and a ""penalty"" for its purchases of Russian oil.
""I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours because they're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine,"" Trump told CNBC in a Tuesday phone interview.
On Wednesday, the American president doubled that rate to 50%. The higher levy would take effect within 21 days.
India's external affairs ministry pushed back, saying on Monday that its energy imports are focused on ensuring ""predictable and affordable energy costs"" for Indian consumers.
Trump said last week that he wants a deal to end Russia's war with Ukraine by August 8.
""Putin will stop killing people if you get energy down another $10 a barrel. He's going to have no choice because his economy stinks,"" Trump told CNBC on Tuesday.
Even with Trump's ultimatum, Russia is likely to dig in its heels, according to Tatiana Orlova, a lead emerging markets economist at Oxford Economics.
""The Russian leadership seems to view the economy's resilience during the first three and a half years of war as proof that it is immune to further sanctions,"" Orlova wrote in a Wednesday note.
She estimates there's a 70% chance Russia continues the war.
If that happens, Washington is likely to respond with additional sanctions, particularly targeting Russia's energy sector, she said.
""The Russian economy is rapidly losing momentum, and additional 'biting' sanctions could tip it into recession, depending on the severity of the new measures,"" she added.
India could make a deal for trade relief
While most analysts believe India is unlikely to drastically reduce its Russian oil intake, some say it could be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with Washington.
""Some reduction in Russian oil imports as part of a grand bargain is not outlandish, given that Russian crude share of total crude imports has surged from being negligible to ~38% since 2022,"" wrote Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's head of macro research for Asia, excluding Japan.
Varathan cited the ""dire threat of unrelenting US geo-economic pressures"" as a key factor in why Delhi could reduce dependency on Russian oil as part of a trade deal with Trump.
Crude oil futures rose briefly following Trump's tariff threats but ended Wednesday lower as weak fundamentals persist.
US crude oil futures are down about 10% year to date, with global supply remaining strong as OPEC ramps up output. Demand from China, a major importer, is also weak amid a prolonged economic slowdown.
Analysts at ING said the market could absorb modest price increases if India cuts Russian oil imports and shifts to other suppliers. But they warned broader pullbacks could be disruptive.
""If India were to stop buying Russian oil amid tariff threats, we believe the market would be able to cope with the loss of this supply,"" wrote commodities strategists at ING in a Wednesday note.
However, the bigger risk is if other major Russian oil buyers also start to avoid buying the commodity.
""This would require OPEC to tap into its spare production capacity quickly and aggressively to balance the market. This could result in significant further upside for prices,"" they wrote."

Far-Flung Postcards is a weekly series in which NPR's international correspondents share snapshots of moments from their lives and work around the world.
Banyan trees are my constant companion as I travel in India. These trees sprawl out, sending down roots that grow from their branches like ropes that children swing on. In both Hindu and Muslim areas, it's not unusual to see oil lamps nestled in reverence at the tangle of banyan roots — the tree is seen as life-giving. Sometimes, there are strips of cloth fluttering off branches in hopes of prayers answered.
The trees are also shade-giving, like this one I saw in late spring outside Dingucha village in the western state of Gujarat. These men were sitting quite still in the late-afternoon heat, catching a break next to a stall that sells paan, a mixture of ground betel nut and flavorings. The light looked sepia-toned — as if I'd stepped into an old photograph — and I began snapping. There was no such respite, though, for the stream of young women I saw walking past, balancing heavy pots of water on their heads — a grueling task they're sometimes expected to repeat several times a day.

The FIDE Women's Chess World Cup is among the most grueling of tournaments. It goes on for nearly a month and features more than 100 players, prodigies to world champions, across age and nationalities.
India's 19-year-old Divya Deshmukh entered this year's event in Georgia as an underdog. Over the course of the July tournament, she had opponents ranked far higher than her on the ropes, pushing them to tie-breakers, forcing errors under time pressure.
She was in tears after her final round thriller against another chess master from India — the world's #6 ranked Koneru Humpy. After winning the match, all Deshmukh could talk about was her mistakes. ""I'm pretty sure at some point I messed it up,"" she said, ""perhaps I should not have allowed g4, I should've just gone rook a3-f3-g3 and that should be a win."" (For all you non-chess gurus, these abbreviations describe certain moves.)
She allowed herself a smile only when the interviewer interrupted her: ""Divya, you just won the World Cup!""
The tenacity of players like Deshmukh is in part why Indian chess has had a dream-run in recent years. Last year, both of its men's and women's teams swept the Chess Olympiad — the Olympics of chess — held in Budapest, Hungary. At the World Chess Championship in Singapore, held in December, Indian national Gukesh Dommaraju became the youngest-ever world champion at age 18. Even the final round of this year's women's chess world cup was an all-Indian affair.
Deshmukh's victory makes her India's 88th ""grand master"" — a title given only to the world's best. It also doubles India's chances at next year's women's world chess championship.
This is a remarkable shift. After decades of Russian and European chess dominance, the spotlight is on India, the likely birthplace of the ancient game. Many historians believe that modern chess originated from chaturanga, an ancient Indian board game that spread to the world via traders, pilgrims and conquerors.
Home of champs
Chess has seen a worldwide resurgence since the pandemic-induced lockdown. Netflix's smash-hit chess drama The Queen's Gambit came out the year the pandemic started, and with more leisure time, people began playing on platforms like chess.com and watching on YouTube. India has been among the biggest beneficiaries of the boom.
Deshmukh belongs to Nagpur, a city in central India better known for its oranges than sportspersons. She was introduced to the game at age 5 accidentally. As she said in a 2023 interview, she wanted to join a badminton club but a coach pointed out she was too short for the game. ""There was a chess class happening in the same building, so my parents took me there. I liked the sport. Then, I just stuck with chess.""
But the southern state of Tamil Nadu, and its coastal capital Chennai, is seen as the epicenter of chess. A third of all Indian grand masters are born in Tamil Nadu. Both of India's world champions, Viswanathan Anand, a five-time winner, and Gukesh Dommaraju, the current reigning champion, are from Chennai.
Chennai is the ""factory of Indian chess,"" says Venkat Saravanan, a chess trainer who often writes about the game for national newspapers.
He says the city's excellence is created by a system of ""teaching from the grassroots."" Some schools grant promising chess players holidays to train and travel. Local businesses pay their expenses. Then there are Chennai's parents.
Typically, Indian parents don't encourage their kids to seriously pursue sports. ""In India, we have this basic belief among parents that our way to happiness and prosperity is through academics,"" says Saravanan. ""Chess in some respects resembles academics.""
It's why chess clubs have mushroomed across the city, many of them run by former grand masters.
Training the next chess generation
At the Madras Chess Academy, children trickle in after school. They sit in a windowless room, surrounded by portraits of chess legends, including world champion Gukesh Dommaraju, once a student here.
Many of these dozen or so kids spend their weekends sparring at chess tournaments across Chennai. If they perform well, trainers like Selvabharathy — he only has one name — invites them to stand before the class, and orders the other kids to clap, as he did on a recent day.
""That's what I mean: 100% honesty and dedication toward chess,"" says Selvabharathy, pointing to the pint-sized boy standing awkwardly in front of the other children. ""Don't say, 'Sir, I don't have time.' Everyone has time.""
Chess coach Vishnu Prasanna started this academy two years ago. He says the day before NPR visited, one parent walked in with their 3 1/2-year-old child to train. Another parent, Suresh Dasarathan, proudly shared his 6-year-old son's daily routine: Wake up at 7, an hour of chess practice, school, then an hour of chess coaching at the club, then homework and bedtime at 9 p.m.
""If he's good at chess,"" Dasarathan says, he'll support his son all the way to international games. ""That is a dream. My dream.""
Parents often play a crucial role in the success of young prodigies. Gukesh's father Rajinikanth would put his day-job as a surgeon on hold to double up as a de facto manager of his son. The mother of chess' star siblings Praggnananda and Vaishali Rameshbabu often travels with them with Indian spices and cookware so her kids can eat home-cooked meals of rice and sambar soup.
But one 6-year-old girl, Rivina, says some parents at chess tournaments also get overbearing. ""They will say, 'I will give you dinner only if you win this game.' Some kids will just cry if they don't win,"" she says.
India's first world champ and his ""kids""
The Soviet Union dominated the chess world for most of the 20th century. In 1972, American maverick Bobby Fischer first breached the frontier by winning the world championship at the height of the Cold War. Other countries produced chess stars. In 1995, India got its first world champion in Chennai-born Viswanathan Anand. Today, his successors in India are often called ""Vishy's kids.""
Now 55, Anand is still among the world's top 10 players. In his heyday, he says, chess was a hobby to be tolerated, something parents discouraged so you could go ""back to your studies, because you need a real job.""
Anand thinks the culture surrounding chess has changed because now, it's something you can make a living from. That's key in a country where good-paying jobs are scarce.
The Indian government often gives high-ranking players a job in the public sector — a dream opportunity for many because of the job security and perks: monthly pay, housing allowance, pension, insurance and paid leave they can use to practice. High-ranking players can win prize money in a newly launched global Chess League. Many also work as chess coaches.
Player and coach Srinath Narayanan says such opportunities of forging a career in chess is why Indian parents often drive their kids so hard.
""In India, there is a massive supply of people and very limited seats available for excellence. And something like sport is also seen as a way to jump the queue.""
But some chess watchers say there's a major obstacle to India becoming the world's unchallenged chess power: the English language. Most chess books, software and classes are in English. The government's 2011 population census found that a little more than 10% of Indians fluently speak the language. Most English-speakers in India are from the country's middle and upper classes.
Enter YouTube
One man wants to move beyond that.
Two years ago, Venkatesh Enumalai founded the Tamil Chess Channel on YouTube. It teaches the basics of chess in Tamil, a language spoken by some 80 million Indians, concentrated in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The channel has more than 80,000 followers and millions of views, including among Tamil-speakers in Sri Lanka and the United States. One of his students there, he says, became a state champion in Illinois recently.
Buoyed by such success stories, Enumalai quit his day job with the sales team of a pharma company and started a chess club in Chennai, offering coaching at a little over $10 a month to make it affordable. He says he intends to travel and conduct chess boot camps for students in rural parts.
As the world's most populous country, India has numbers on its side. Enumalai says it just needs a nudge to become a chess powerhouse. ""If we can nurture so many people at the bottom level, maybe we will be able to become a number one nation.""

https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/09/iphone-17-higher-prices-likely-says-analyst/,"iPhone 17 models will ""likely"" be more expensive than iPhone 16 models in the U.S., according to Jeff Pu, an analyst at investment firm GF Securities.
In a research note this week, Pu attributed the potential iPhone 17 price increases to the U.S. imposing tariffs on products imported from countries where the iPhone is assembled, including China and India. Apple is currently paying a 20% tariff on iPhones imported from China, but none on iPhones imported from India, according to The Wall Street Journal. However, the Trump administration's tariff policies frequently change.
On an earnings call last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the majority of the iPhones sold in the U.S. are imported from India currently.
Wall Street analysts have estimated that iPhone 17 models could be $50 to $100 more expensive than the equivalent iPhone 16 models, but this is likely guesswork. Even if prices do increase, Apple could find clever ways to spin the situation, such as by raising the iPhone 17 Pro's minimum storage capacity from 128GB to 256GB. That would bring the Pro model in line with the Pro Max model, which has started at the 256GB mark for a few years now.
In the U.S., Apple has maintained a $999 starting price for the Pro model or equivalent since the iPhone X was released all the way back in 2017, despite rumors about potential price increases year after year. So, Apple has earned the benefit of the doubt on pricing until proven otherwise. On the other hand, nothing lasts forever.

(Reuters) -Physical gold demand in India improved slightly this week as a price pullback lifted buying interest among consumers, while activity in other top Asian hubs remained lacklustre.
Gold prices in India closed at 99,838 rupees ($1,139.61) per 10 grams on Thursday after hitting a record high of 102,250 rupees last week.
""Many retail consumers are waiting for a price correction, but with prices steady around 100,000 rupees for the past few months, some buyers have begun purchasing,"" said a Mumbai-based jeweller.
Indian dealers offered discounts of up to $6 per ounce to official domestic prices, inclusive of 6% import and 3% sales levies, compared with an up to $9 discount to a premium of $2 last week.
Jewellers placed healthy orders with manufacturers at the India International Jewellery Show for the upcoming festival season despite elevated prices, said a Mumbai-based bullion dealer with a private bank.
Indians will celebrate the Dussehra and Diwali festivals in October, when buying gold is considered auspicious.
In top consumer China, bullion changed hands anywhere between discounts of $7 to a $6 premium an ounce over the global benchmark spot price.
""Physical gold demand in Asia remains mixed. The jewellery sector continues to struggle under the weight of high prices... with no new import quotas announced, actual physical demand from Chinese traders appears to be more limited,"" said Bernard Sin, regional director of Greater China at MKS PAMP.
""Tariff news sparked and reversed. No major gold relocations or withdrawals were seen.""
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would not impose tariffs on gold, ending days of speculation that the metal could be caught up in the ongoing global trade spat.
In Hong Kong, gold was sold at par to a premium of $1.60, while in Singapore, gold traded between at-par prices and a $2 premium.
In Japan, bullion was sold at a discount of $0.50 over spot prices, according to a Tokyo-based trader.

MONTREAL/NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India wants countries to agree a new code of conduct on hiring each other's airline staff after raising concerns that its fast-growing aviation system is being stifled by the poaching of Indian pilots and cabin crew without adequate notice.
India, one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, is wrestling with a shortage of experienced pilots, denting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's aspiration of developing a job-creating global aviation hub. The recent fatal crash of an Air India jetliner has sparked tighter scrutiny of the sector.
But foreign airlines are repeatedly hiring skilled staff from Indian airlines, ""adversely impacting India’s ability to develop its civil aviation sector in an orderly manner,"" India said in an August 1 working paper submitted to the U.N.'s aviation agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization.
""Airlines from other (countries) tend to recruit experienced pilots, engineers, technicians, and cabin crew from Indian carriers, preventing India's civil aviation sector from achieving planned and orderly growth,"" India wrote in the paper, without identifying any foreign airline by name.
""This practice creates a vicious cycle where Indian carriers are forced to continuously recruit and train replacement personnel by diverting resources from expansion activities and operational improvements.""
The paper was released on the ICAO website ahead of its triennial assembly. It has not previously been reported.
India's Civil Aviation Ministry was not immediately available for comment.
India's government said in April the country would need 30,000 pilots over the next 15–20 years, up from the current 6,000–7,000, as airlines collectively had more than 1,700 aircraft on order.
India's domestic aviation sector is led by IndiGo and Air India, while all major international airlines from Emirates to British Airways to Lufthansa operate regular flights. In 2023, Air India exchanged barbs with Akasa Air over the poaching of pilots domestically.
The working paper asks for the creation of a code of conduct on the movement of skilled aviation workers among ICAO's member countries.
It doesn't specify how the code of conduct would work.
""These challenges cause economic losses that affect Indian carriers’ ability to compete in international markets ... and achieve its ambitious target of 300 million domestic passengers by 2030,"" the paper said.
ICAO, which seeks to use consensus to set standards on everything from runways to seat belts, was created after the United States invited more than 50 allies to agree in 1944 to a common air navigation system.

Decades after Pakistani troops killed his friends in Bangladesh's independence war, veteran freedom fighter Syed Abu Naser Bukhtear Ahmed eyes warming ties between Dhaka and Islamabad with cautious pragmatism.
Bangladesh is hosting the foreign minister and trade envoy this week, its most senior Pakistani visitors in years, in a bid to reset relations scarred by the bloody 1971 conflict and shaped by shifting regional power balances.
""The brutality was unbounded,"" said Ahmed, 79, a banker, describing the war in which East Pakistan broke away to form Bangladesh.
Hundreds of thousands were killed -– Bangladeshi estimates say millions -– and Pakistan's military was accused of widespread atrocities.
""I would have loved to see the responsible people tried -- the ones who killed six of my friends,"" Ahmed told AFP.
""I don't mind normalising relations with those who opposed the war, but were not directly involved in the atrocities committed.""
Contact between the two Muslim-majority nations was long limited to little more than cultural ties: a shared love of cricket, music and Pakistan's prized cotton used to make the flowing trousers and shirt known as shalwar kameez.
Bangladesh instead leaned heavily on India, which almost encircles the country of 170 million people.
- 'Flirting' -
However, a mass uprising in Dhaka last year that toppled longtime India ally Sheikh Hasina has strained ties with New Delhi and opened the door for dialogue with Islamabad.
More in World
Pakistan's Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan arrived in Dhaka on Thursday and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is expected on Saturday.
Analysts say India, which fought a four-day conflict with Pakistan in May, will be watching closely.
""Bangladesh had been one of India's closest partners in its neighbourhood, and now it is flirting with India's chief adversary,"" said Michael Kugelman, a US-based analyst.
The last time a Pakistani foreign minister visited Dhaka was in 2012, according to Bangladesh newspapers.
Pakistan and Bangladesh began sea trade last year, expanding government-to-government commerce in February.
""It is the emergence of a new strategic equation -- one that reduces Indian influence and instead strengthens a cooperative axis between Pakistan and Bangladesh,"" Azeem Khalid, a New York-based international relations expert, told AFP.
""If sustained, this evolution has the potential to reshape South Asia's geopolitical and economic order.""
Bangladesh's interim government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus is furious that Hasina fled to India and has defied a summons to answer charges amounting to crimes against humanity.
""Under Yunus, there have been a number of high-level meetings, trade relations have expanded, the two countries have agreed to relax visa rules and there has even been some limited military cooperation,"" said analyst Thomas Kean from the International Crisis Group.
- 'Wound remains open' -
Still, reconciliation faces obstacles.
Calls for Pakistan to apologise for the 1971 killings remain popular in Bangladesh, but foreign policy expert Qamar Cheema believes it is unlikely Islamabad will oblige.
""Pakistan's engagement with Bangladesh is only possible if Bangladesh does not bring historical animosity in re-establishing ties"", said Cheema, from Islamabad's Sanober Institute.
""Bangladesh always demanded an apology, which (Pakistan) never provided -- and even today, doesn't have any such intentions.""
Dhaka's foreign affairs adviser Mohammad Touhid Hossain, asked if Bangladesh would raise the issue of a public apology, said that ""all issues will be on the table"".
Bangladesh courts have sentenced several people for ""genocide"" during the 1971 war, accusing them of aiding Pakistani forces in the ethnic cleansing of Bengalis.
""As long as the wound remains open, the relationship cannot be sustainable,"" said anthropologist Sayeed Ferdous from Dhaka's Jahangirnagar University.
Others strike a more balanced tone.
""From a victim's perspective, I can't accept a warming of bilateral relations before Pakistan meets certain conditions,"" said Bangladeshi academic Meghna Guhathakurta, whose father was killed by Pakistani troops.
She said Islamabad ""should make all information related to the war public"".
However, the retired international relations professor from Dhaka University also accepted that it was ""natural to have trade relations with Pakistan"", and acknowledged the ""geopolitical dimensions"".
With elections in February, when Yunus's administration will hand over power, relations could shift once again.
""If the next government is prepared to patch up ties with India -- and Delhi is willing to reciprocate -- then the surge in ties with Islamabad could become a casualty,"" Kugelman said.

India Dispatch: The strongest case for India is not merely that it is young, but that it still has time, and it may be the only continental-scale economy that still has it in abundance. India won't cross the demographic threshold for an ""old"" country -- a median age of 41 -- until the late 2050s, while China reaches that point now. India requires 10.4% sustained GDP growth over 35 years to become rich before aging, compared to China's needed 32% annual growth rate. India's working-age population will increase from 67.5% in 2021 to 69.2% by 2031, with the median age remaining at 34.5 in 2036. The report adds: China's compressed dilemma mirrors what is gripping the developed world, where Europe's share of population over 65 is on track to hit 30% by 2050, up from 8% in 1950. Raising retirement ages -- what economists describe as the closest thing to a silver bullet -- faces older voting blocs, who now make up roughly 40% of those who turn up at the polls in European elections. In the U.S., what J.P. Morgan analysts term a ""Social Security cliff"" looms by 2033, when the system's trust funds are projected to be exhausted, and hopes that productivity miracles (powered by, hopefully AI) will quietly square this circle look optimistic, leaving much of the rich world and North Asia out of time.

The 1935 Social Security Act did define a system that was designed as a pure pay-as-you-go system with the expectation that a large reserve would accumulate, but the 1937 recession convinced people to change that.

I have had to deal with people from India for many years. Here's my analysis: the caste system there is still very strong. So what you get is educated people with a sense of entitlement and arrogance matched only (in many cases, but definitely not all) with utter incompetence. Mostly, it's people from the top caste who get the opportunities, and these are the people I have had to deal with. Individual Indian people may do well, but when you take somebody competent and ask them to deal with an upper caste ""engineer"", the only way it works is if you can find a way to work around the fucker.

I think you've misanalysed the situation. India's upper caste can be incredibly competent, but what they entire country is, is culturally task driven. People have a task, not a job. They do the task as defined, they don't have a tendency to think outside the box, come up with solutions, question others (and this makes it very difficult for us westerners to work with them).
Example from a few weeks ago: Security at our office. The guy's task was to put the bags through the xray machine. He didn't do the job of keeping the place secure, he just did the task. The fun part was EVERYTHING went through the xray machine. Regardless of how obviously pointless it was to xray, either because the thing itself didn't need xraying or because ... no one was sitting at the screen of the xray machine. We have the same situation with our Indian engineers. You give them a task to do they will do that task. If your request contains a typo that typo will be faithfully reproduced at the end. When asked if they saw that they say ""yes, it doesn't make sense, I think it should have said xxxx, but I was asked to do it so I did it.""
This looks like incompetence, it's not, it's just culturally different. I have great success with our Indian engineers since I frame their requirement to think into the task itself when we request them to do work. There's still a few incompetent people out there, but they come from all backgrounds.

The beta program has finally been spotted for Samsung's past-gen models in a couple of countries.
What you need to know
- An X tipster reports spotting the One UI 8 Beta Program in the U.K. and South Korea for the Galaxy S24, Flip 6, and Fold 6.
- The patch appears to be roughly 3GB and includes the recent August security patch for the devices.
- Users trying to get into the program in India have reported difficulties, potentially indicating Samsung ongoing preparations.
- Samsung confirmed that even more past-gen models will see One UI 8 testing, like the Galaxy S23, in September.
Several of Samsung's past-gen Galaxy devices are picking up its promised Android 16 beta in two countries.
Earlier today (Aug 13), Tarun Vats on X posted a heads-up about the Galaxy S24 receiving the One UI 8 (Android 16) beta in the U.K. (via GSMArena). Vats spotted build numbers for the S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra in the region, marking the start of their beta program. Samsung's official changelog appearing on devices states U.K. users will find a ~3GB download size for One UI 8.
Moreover, the changelog informs users that only the unlocked version of the S24 models is eligible for this test. The August 1 security patch is also rolling in for users who're signing up for the beta program in the U.K.
A separate X post states the One UI 8 beta is starting in South Korea for the Galaxy S24 series, as well as the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and the Fold 6. While the program's appearance in these two countries indicates its slow rollout around the world, some users are reporting a curious occurrence in India. Some users seeking out the beta program in India report a banner that says ""recruitment closed."" It's left many users on X bewildered as to what's going on.
Perhaps this will be rectified as the week winds down. We should also see the beta program begin in the U.S. soon, too.
A One UI 8 Adventure
Samsung confirmed the One UI 8 Beta Program would go live for the S24 series, alongside its Flip 6 and Fold 6, this week. The only issue is that the beta's appearance is seemingly two days late, as Samsung originally proposed an August 11 start. Regardless, the Korean OEM confirmed the program's initiation in India and the U.S., the U.K., and South Korea. We've seen reports for two out of four so far; now we just need to wait for the rest.
In September, Samsung teased even more devices would hop aboard the One UI 8 testing train, such as the Galaxy S23 series, Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5, Tab S10 series, and other mid-range models.

At the end of July, One UI 8's fourth beta rolled out for the Galaxy S25. We're hoping that we're on the final stretch of this beta program for the latest flagship model, as Samsung hauled in a bunch of fixes for the trio. The company already has its Good Lock ecosystem in order for One UI 8, further signaling the software's (hopeful) impending release, now that we've moved into August.

The app can now translate your conversations in real time, too.
For now, Google Translate can only help English speakers practice Spanish and French, as well as help Spanish, French, and Portuguese speakers practice English. When you tap the new Practice button in the Google Translate app, you can select your skill level and describe your goal. You can also choose from preset scenarios, such as using the language for professional conversations, everyday interactions, talking with friends and family, and more.
Google will then use its Gemini AI models to generate a lesson based on your response. If you tell Google that you have intermediate Spanish skills and want to communicate with your host family while studying abroad, Translate might create a recommended scenario to help you learn about meal times. From there, you can either practice speaking about the topic with Translate or listen to conversations and tap the words you recognize.
“These exercises track your daily progress and help you build the skills you need to communicate in another language with confidence,” Matt Sheets, a product manager at Google, said during a press briefing. The setup sounds a bit similar to Duolingo, which also tailors lesson plans based on your skill level and goals.
Additionally, Google has launched a live translation feature in the Translate app, allowing you to have back-and-forth conversations with someone even if you don’t speak the same language. The feature translates your speech into your speaker’s preferred language by creating an AI-generated transcription and audio translation, and vice versa. Unlike live translation on the Google Pixel 10, the Google Translate app doesn’t try to make the AI-generated audio sound like your voice, but Sheets told reporters that the company is “experimenting with different options there.”
Live translation is currently available to users in the US, India, and Mexico, and works in more than 70 languages, including Arabic, French, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, and Tamil.

https://gizmodo.com/now-that-google-is-trash-it-will-let-you-pick-your-own-news-sources-2000642077,"Google seems to have destroyed the quality of its search results (and its reputation) by loading its feed with sponsored results, pages boosted by SEO black magic, and AI-generated slop. So it’s putting the control back in your hands, for better or worse. The company announced today via blog post a new feature called Preferred Sources that will let users select their own favorite news outlets to appear at the top of their personalized search feed.
According to Google, the feature has already started rolling out for users in the United States and India. Through Preferred Sources, users will be able to select outlets they like to read, whether it’s national outlets, local papers, or niche blogs. Once selected, Google will start to populate your feed with related stories from your chosen outlets, displaying relevant results in the Top Stories section of search.
If you’re eligible to use the feature, you’ll see an icon next to the “Top Stories” section of search when you hit Google with a query. Tap it, and you’ll be able to search for your favorite outlets. Check the publications you want, and Google will start to serve you more results from those publications, both in the Top Stories section and in a new section that may appear in your results with the heading “From your sources.” According to The Verge, there is no limit on the number of outlets you can add to your Preferred Sources list, so load it up if you want to.
Google is also giving tools to publishers to encourage their readers to add their publication to a person’s Preferred Sources list, including a “call to action” button that can be displayed that reads “Add as a preferred source on Google.” So get ready to see that as publications try to hang onto their Google Search traffic for dear life. (Totally unrelated, but if you feel like adding Gizmodo to your Preferred Sources, that’d be real cool of you.)
Google has denied that its AI push and summaries have done any damage to search traffic for publications, despite plenty of evidence to the contrary, including major publications reporting major dropoffs in visitors coming from links served by Google. The company has also rejected the suggestion that its results are getting worse due to malicious actors trying to manipulate SEO and algorithms or from its own AI-curated trash. But it’s hard to read this “pick your own sources” solution as a sort of tacit admission that its results aren’t really giving people what they want. Now, is it a good idea to let people actively reinforce their own viewpoints by selecting the sources they want to see? That’s a whole other question."

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/modi-trump-once-called-other-202918161.html,"Modi and Trump once called each other good friends. Now the US-India relationship is getting bumpy
NEW DELHI (AP) — The men shared bear hugs, showered praise on each other and made appearances side by side at stadium rallies — a big optics boost for two populist leaders with ideological similarities. Each called the other a good friend.
In India, the bonhomie between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump was seen as a relationship like no other. That is, until a series of events gummed up the works.
From Trump’s tariffs and India’s purchase of oil from Russia to a U.S. tilt toward Pakistan, friction between New Delhi and Washington has been hard to miss. And much of it has happened far from the corridors of power and, unsurprisingly, through Trump’s posts on social media.
It has left policy experts wondering whether the camaraderie the two leaders shared may be a thing of the past, even though Donald Trump has stopped short of referring to Modi directly on social media. The dip in rapport, some say, puts a strategic bilateral relationship built over decades at risk.
“This is a testing time for the relationship,” said Ashok Malik, a former policy adviser in India’s Foreign Ministry.
The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
Simmering tensions over trade and tariffs
The latest hiccup between India and the U.S. emerged last week when Trump announced that he was slapping 25% tariffs on India as well as an unspecified penalty because of India’s purchasing of Russian oil. For New Delhi, such a move from its largest trading partner is expected to be felt across sectors, but it also led to a sense of unease in India — even more so when Trump, on social media, called India’s economy “dead.”
Trump’s recent statements reflect his frustration with the pace of trade talks with India, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal administration thinking. The Republican president has not been pursuing any strategic realignment with Pakistan, according to the official, but is instead trying to play hardball in negotiations.
Trump doubled down on the pressure Monday with a fresh post on Truth Social, in which he accused India of buying “massive amounts” of oil from Russia and then “selling it on the Open Market for big profits.”
More in World
“They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA,” he said.
The messaging appears to have stung Modi’s administration, which has been hard-selling negotiations with Trump’s team over a trade deal by balancing between India’s protectionist system while also opening up the country’s market to more American goods.
“Strenuous, uninterrupted and bipartisan efforts in both capitals over the past 25 years are being put at risk by not just the tariffs but by fast and loose statements and social media posts,” said Malik, who now heads the India chapter of The Asia Group, a U.S. advisory firm .
Malik also said the trade deal the Indian side has offered to the U.S. is the “most expansive in this country’s history,” referring to reports that India was willing to open up to some American agricultural products. That is a politically sensitive issue for Modi, who faced a yearlong farmers’ protest a few years ago.
Trump appears to be tilting toward Pakistan
The unraveling may have gained momentum over tariffs, but the tensions have been palpable for a while. Much of it has to do with Trump growing closer to Pakistan, India’s nuclear rival in the neighborhood.
In May, India and Pakistan traded a series of military strikes over a gun massacre in disputed Kashmir that New Delhi blamed Islamabad for. Pakistan denied the accusations. The four-day conflict made the possibility of a nuclear conflagration between the two sides seem real and the fighting only stopped when global powers intervened.
But it was Trump’s claims of mediation and an offer to work to provide a “solution” regarding the dispute over Kashmir that made Modi’s administration uneasy. Since then, Trump has repeated nearly two dozen times that he brokered peace between India and Pakistan.
For Modi, that is a risky — even nervy — territory. Domestically, he has positioned himself as a leader who is tough on Pakistan. Internationally, he has made huge diplomatic efforts to isolate the country. So Trump’s claims cut a deep wound, prompting a sense in India that the U.S. may no longer be its strategic partner.
India insists that Kashmir is India’s internal issue and had opposed any third-party intervention. Last week Modi appeared to dismiss Trump’s claims after India’s Opposition began demanding answers from him. Modi said that “no country in the world stopped” the fighting between India and Pakistan, but he did not name Trump.
Trump has also appeared to be warming up to Pakistan, even praising its counterterrorism efforts. Hours after levying tariffs on India, Trump announced a “massive” oil exploration deal with Pakistan, saying that some day, India might have to buy oil from Islamabad. Earlier, he also hosted one of Pakistan’s top military officials at a private lunch.
Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, an expert at New Delhi’s Jindal School of International Affairs, said Trump’s sudden admiration for Pakistan as a great partner in counterterrorism has “definitely soured” the mood in India.
Chaulia said “the best-case scenario is that this is just a passing Trump whim,” but he also warned that “if financial and energy deals are indeed being struck between the U.S. and Pakistan, it will dent the U.S.-India strategic partnership and lead to loss of confidence in the U.S. in Indian eyes.”
India’s oil purchases from Russia are an irritant
The strain in relations has also to do with oil.
India had faced strong pressure from the Biden administration to cut back its oil purchases from Moscow during the early months of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Instead, India bought more, making it the second-biggest buyer of Russian oil after China. That pressure sputtered over time and the U.S. focused more on building strategic ties with India, which is seen as a bulwark against a rising China.
Trump’s threat to penalize India over oil, however, brought back those issues.
On Sunday, the Trump administration made its frustrations over ties between India and Russia ever more public. Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff at the White House, accused India of financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow, saying it was “not acceptable.”
Miller's remarks were followed by another Trump social media post on Monday in which he again threatened to raise tariffs on goods from India over its Russian oil purchases.
“India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,"" Trump wrote.
Some experts, though, suspect Trump's remarks are mere pressure tactics. “Given the wild fluctuations in Trump’s policies,” Chaulia said, “it may return to high fives and hugs again.”
India says it will safeguard its interests
Many expected India to react strongly over Trump's tariff threats considering Modi’s carefully crafted reputation of strength. Instead, the announcement prompted a rather careful response from India’s commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, who said the two countries are working toward a “fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement.”
Initially, India’s Foreign Ministry also played down suggestions of any strain. But in a statement late Monday, it called Trump’s criticism “unjustified and unreasonable” and said it will take “all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.”
It said India began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, calling it a “necessity compelled by global market situation.”
The statement also noted U.S. trade with Russia.
“It is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia,” the statement said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India aims to allow private firms to mine, import and process uranium as part of plans to end a decades-old state monopoly over the nuclear sector and bring in billions of dollars to boost the industry, two government sources said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government plans to expand nuclear power production capacity by 12 times by 2047 and it is also relaxing requirements to allow foreign players to take a minority stake in power plants, Reuters reported in April.
If it meets its expansion goal, nuclear will provide 5% of India's total power needs, according to government estimates.
Until now, the state has maintained control over the mining, import and processing of uranium fuel because of concerns over the possible misuse of nuclear material, radiation safety and strategic security.
It will retain its grip on reprocessing spent uranium fuel and managing plutonium waste, in line with global practice.
But to help meet a surge in demand for nuclear fuel as it expands nuclear power production, the government plans to draw up a regulatory framework that would allow private Indian firms to mine, import and process uranium, the two government sources told Reuters.
They asked not to be named because the plans are not yet public.
The proposed policy, which the sources said was likely to be made public in the current fiscal year, will also permit private players to supply critical control system equipment for nuclear power plants, they said.
The Finance Ministry, Department of Atomic Energy and Prime Minister's Office did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Outside India, countries including Canada, South Africa and the United States allow private firms to mine and process uranium.
DOMESTIC SUPPLY IS NOT ENOUGH
India has an estimated 76,000 tonnes of uranium enough to fuel 10,000 megawatts of nuclear power for 30 years, according to government data.
But the sources said domestic resources would only be able to meet about 25% of the projected increase. The rest would have to be imported and India would need to increase its processing capacity.
In announcing its budget on February 1, the government made public its plans to open up the sector without giving details.
Some of India's big conglomerates subsequently began drawing up investment plans.
But analysts said amending the legislation could be complex.
""It's a major and bold initiative by the Indian Government which is critical for achieving the target,"" said Charudatta Palekar, independent power sector consultant."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/cloudbursts-causing-chaos-parts-india-193329671.html,"Cloudbursts are causing chaos in parts of India and Pakistan. Here's what they are
ISLAMABAD (AP) — Cloudbursts are causing chaos in mountainous parts of India and Pakistan, with tremendous amounts of rain falling in a short period of time over a concentrated area. The intense, sudden deluges have proved fatal in both countries.
As many as 300 people died in one northwestern Pakistani district, Buner, after a cloudburst. The strength and volume of rain triggered flash flooding, landslides and mudflows. Boulders from steep slopes came crashing down with the water to flatten homes and reduce villages to rubble.
The northern Indian state of Uttarakhand had a cloudburst earlier this month. Local TV showed floodwaters surging down a mountain and crashing into Dharali, a Himalayan village. In 2013, more than 6,000 people died and 4,500 villages were affected when a similar cloudburst struck the state.
Here’s what to know about cloudbursts:
They are complex and extreme weather events
A cloudburst occurs when a large volume of rain falls in a very short period, usually more than 100 millimeters (about 4 inches) within an hour over a localized area, around 30 square kilometers (11.6 square miles).
Cloudbursts are sudden and violent, with devastating consequences and widespread destruction, and can be the equivalent of several hours of normal rainfall or longer. The event is the bursting of a cloud and the discharge of its contents at the same time, like a rain bomb.
Several factors contribute to a cloudburst, including warm, moist air rising upward, high humidity, low pressure, instability and convective cloud formation.
Moist air is forced to rise after encountering a hill or mountain. This rising air cools and condenses. Clouds that are large, dense and capable of heavy rainfall form.
Hills or mountains act like barriers and often trap these clouds, so they cannot disperse or move easily. Strong upward currents keep moisture suspended inside the clouds, delaying rainfall.
More in World
When the clouds cannot hold the accumulated moisture anymore, they burst and release it all at once.
India and Pakistan have ideal conditions
Cloudbursts thrive in moisture, monsoons and mountains. Regions of India and Pakistan have all three, making them vulnerable to these extreme weather events.
The Himalayas, Karakoram and Hindu Kush mountain ranges are home to the world’s highest and most famous peaks, spanning multiple countries including India and Pakistan.
The frequency of cloudbursts in these two South Asian nations has been steadily rising due to a warming atmosphere, because a warmer air mass can hold more moisture, creating conditions for sudden and intense downpours.
The South Asian region has traditionally had two monsoon seasons. One typically lasts from June to September, with rains moving southwest to northeast. The other, from roughly October to December, moves in the opposite direction.
But with more planet-warming gases in the air, the rain now only loosely follows this pattern.
This is because the warmer air can hold more moisture from the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, and that rain then tends to get dumped all at once. It means the monsoon is punctuated with intense flooding and dry spells, rather than sustained rain throughout.
The combination of moisture, mountains and monsoons force these moisture-laden winds upward, triggering sudden condensation and cloudbursts.
They are hard to predict, but precaution is possible
It’s difficult to predict cloudbursts because of their size, duration, suddenness and complex atmospheric mechanisms.
Asfandyar Khan Khattak, a Pakistani official from the northwest province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said there was “no forecasting system anywhere in the world” that could predict the exact time and location of a cloudburst.
The Pakistani government said that while an early warning system was in place in Buner district, where hundreds of people died after a cloudburst, the downpour was so sudden and intense that it struck before residents could be alerted.
Community organization SOST, which is also the name of a border village in Pakistan’s northern Gilgit-Baltistan region, says precautions are possible.
It advises people to avoid building homes right next to rivers and valleys, to postpone any travel to hilly areas if heavy rain is forecast, to keep an emergency kit ready, and to avoid traveling on mountainous roads during heavy rain or at night.
It recommends afforestation to reduce surface runoff and enhance water absorption, and regular clearing and widening of riverbanks and drainage channels.
Climate change is fueling their frequency
Experts say cloudbursts have increased in recent years, partly due to climate change, while damage from associated storms has also increased due to unplanned development in mountain areas.
Climate change has directly amplified the triggers of cloudbursts in Pakistan, especially. Every 1°C rise allows the air to hold about 7% more moisture, increasing the potential for heavy rainfall in short bursts.
The warming of the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea pushes more moisture into the atmosphere. Melting glaciers and snow alter local weather patterns, making rainfall events more erratic and extreme. Environmental degradation, in the form of deforestation and wetland loss, reduces the land’s ability to absorb water, magnifying flash floods.
Climate change has been a central driver in the destruction seen in Pakistan’s northern areas.
“Rising global temperatures have supercharged the hydrologic cycle, leading to more intense and erratic rainfall,” said Khalid Khan, a former special secretary for climate change in Pakistan and chairman of climate initiative PlanetPulse.
“In our northern regions, warming accelerates glacier melt, adds excessive moisture to the atmosphere, and destabilizes mountain slopes. In short, climate change is making rare events more frequent, and frequent events more destructive.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A top aide to President Donald Trump on Sunday accused India of effectively financing Russia's war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow, after the U.S. leader escalated pressure on New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil.
""What he (Trump) said very clearly is that it is not acceptable for India to continue financing this war by purchasing the oil from Russia,"" said Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff at the White House and one of Trump's most influential aides.
Miller's criticism was some of the strongest yet by the Trump administration about one of the United States' major partners in the Indo-Pacific.
""People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil. That's an astonishing fact,"" Miller said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures.""
The Indian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Indian government sources told Reuters on Saturday that New Delhi will keep purchasing oil from Moscow despite U.S. threats.
A 25% tariff on Indian products went into effect on Friday as a result of its purchase of military equipment and energy from Russia. Trump has also threatened 100% tariffs on U.S. imports from countries that buy Russian oil unless Moscow reaches a major peace deal with Ukraine.

ISLAMABAD -Flooding in Pakistan from water flowing downstream from India was made worse by New Delhi’s suspension of a river-sharing treaty and the collapse of the gates on an Indian barrage, Pakistani officials said on Friday.
Torrential monsoon rains ravaged neighboring adversaries India and Pakistan this week, with further heavy downpours forecast for this weekend. On Friday, in eastern Pakistan, flood waters hit the outskirts of the country’s second biggest city, Lahore, and threatened to submerge the major town of Jhang, in the worst flooding in almost 40 years in that part of the country.
The nations share rivers that originate in India and flow into Pakistan, regulated for more than six decades under the Indus Waters Treaty. That agreement was suspended by India this year, following the shooting of 26 people by militants that New Delhi said were backed by Islamabad, which Pakistan denies.
Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan's Planning Minister, told Reuters that data on water flows which used to be shared by India under the treaty had not passed to Pakistan quickly enough, or in sufficient detail.
“We could have managed better if we had better information,” said Iqbal. “If the Indus Waters Treaty was in operation, we could have mitigated the impact.”
The middle section of Madhopur barrage, which spans the Ravi River in India, was washed away by surging water, video broadcast by Indian media on Thursday showed. Pakistani officials said that this damage unleashed an uncontrolled flow across the border, flooding some parts of Lahore on Friday.
An Indian government source denied there had been any deliberate attempt to flood Pakistan, while confirming that two gates of Madhopur barrage had broken.
Indian authorities were trying to stem the flow on the Ravi River, despite the damage to the barrage, and the flow was being controlled by the Ranjit Sagar Dam upstream, said the source, who declined to be identified, citing government policy.
“India is doing whatever can be done and all the information is being passed on,” said the source. “Incessant rain is causing this flood.”
India's foreign and water resources ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the record.
India sent four flood alerts to Islamabad since Sunday, according to Pakistani officials, including a warning on Friday. New Delhi acknowledges passing on warnings, on humanitarian grounds, but has not provided details.
More in World
When India put the 1960 treaty into abeyance, it stopped the sharing of information between water officials. Instead, warnings were sent this week through India’s embassy in Islamabad.
Iqbal, whose own constituency of Narowal, near the Indian border, was badly flooded, said that climate change had made the annual monsoon less predictable, making it more vital to share data.
“Climate change is not a bilateral issue,” said Iqbal. “It relates to humanity.”
On the Chenab River, Pakistani authorities on Friday blew up part of the riverbank to siphon off some of the water into surrounding land, as it threatened to flood the nearby city of Jhang.
Pakistan evacuated more than 1 million people this week in the east of the country, away from the path of the three overflowing rivers that come from India.
This monsoon season so far, 820 people have died in Pakistan, according to the National Disaster Management Authority. The flooded east of the country is home to half of the 240 million population and serves as the country’s breadbasket, with widespread damage to crops from the deluge.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump again threatened on Monday to raise tariffs on goods from India over its Russian oil purchases, while New Delhi called his attack ""unjustified"" and vowed to protect its economic interests, deepening the trade rift between the two countries.
In a social media post, Trump wrote, ""India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don't care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine.""

A spokesperson for India's foreign ministry said in response that India will ""take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.""
""The targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable,"" the spokesperson added.
Trump has said that from Friday he will impose new sanctions on Russia as well as on countries that buy its energy exports, unless Moscow takes steps to end its 3-1/2 year war with Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no public sign of altering his stance despite the deadline.
Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told Reuters that India will keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trump's threats.
India has faced pressure from the West to distance itself from Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022. New Delhi has resisted, citing its longstanding ties with Russia and economic needs.
Trump had already in July announced 25% tariffs on Indian imports, and U.S. officials have cited a range of geopolitical issues standing in the way of a U.S.-India trade accord.
Trump has also cast the wider BRICS group of developing nations as hostile to the United States. Those nations have dismissed his accusation, saying the group promotes the interests of its members and of developing countries at large.
CRUDE BUYER
India is the biggest buyer of seaborne crude from Russia, importing about 1.75 million barrels per day of Russian oil from January to June this year, up 1% from a year ago, according to data provided to Reuters by trade sources.
India began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, the Indian spokesperson said, calling it a ""necessity compelled by global market situation.""

An anonymous reader shares a report: The Indian IT sector has operated for decades under the dominance of major firms TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and HCLT. The historical growth of these companies was tightly coupled with the U.S. economy through a strong ""multiplier effect,"" where Indian IT export growth significantly outpaced US GDP growth. This reliable growth model is now under pressure.
The multiplier has weakened considerably, falling from a peak of 4.1x to a projected 1.6x. This is contributing to a prolonged slowdown period for India IT exports. A primary factor in this slowdown is a clear shift in client spending priorities.

There has been a significant increase in the number of UK cases of a mosquito-borne virus that can cause sudden fever and joint pain and is normally only found in Africa and southern Asia.
The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says more than 70 cases of the chikungunya virus were reported in the first six months of this year, more than double than in the same period last year – all of them linked to travel.
Chikungunya, while rarely fatal, can leave people experiencing joint pain for years.
The UKHSA is warning travellers to take precautions against mosquito bites.
In most cases, people recover fully within a couple of weeks, but for some, pain can persist for months or even years.
In very rare cases it can be fatal.
While the 73 infections seen in the UK in the first six months of this year is not a huge number, it is more than double the 27 cases over the same period last year.
An outbreak of the virus is under way in the Indian Ocean region, and almost all of the infections were linked to travel in India, Sri Lanka and Mauritius.
Chikungunya is spread by two types of mosquito, neither of which are present in the UK, so there is no risk on onward infection.
But Dr Philip Veal, Consultant in Public Health at UKHSA, says it is a warning to travellers to make sure they take precautions against mosquito bites.
""Chikungunya can be a nasty disease and we're seeing a worrying increase in cases among travellers returning to the UK.
""It is essential to take precautions against mosquito bites when travelling.
""Simple steps, such as using insect repellent, covering up your skin and sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets can greatly reduce the risk.
""Before you travel, check the Travel Health Pro Website for the latest advice on your destination.
""A chikungunya vaccine may also be considered for those travelling to higher-risk regions.""
The same report also says the first ever UK cases of Oropouche virus, normally only found in Central and South America and the Caribbean, have also been detected in travellers returning from Brazil.
This virus is predominantly spread by midge bites rather than mosquitos, with the main type of midge involved in transmission not found in Europe or the UK.
Symptoms include high fever, chills, headache, joint pain and muscle aches.
The UKHSA warns of a rise in Oropouche virus infections globally since 2024, and says pregnant travellers should take particular care following some concerns about the impact the virus can cause during pregnancy.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly647wx9l3o,"India calls Trump's tariff threat over Russian oil 'unjustified'
India has called Donald Trump's threat of ""substantially"" higher tariffs over its purchase of oil from Russia ""unjustified and unreasonable"".
In a post on Truth Social, the US president warned he would raise levies, saying India ""don't care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine"".
India is currently among the largest buyers of Russian oil. It has become an important export market for Moscow after several European countries cut trade when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Trump did not specify what the new tariff would be, but it comes just days after he unveiled a hefty 25% levy on India.
In a statement, a spokesperson for India's foreign ministry, Randhir Jaiswal, said the US had encouraged India to import Russian gas at the start of the conflict, ""for strengthening global energy markets stability"".
He said India ""began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict"".
India also criticised the US - its largest trading partner - for introducing the tariffs, when the US itself is still doing trade with Russia. Last year, the US traded goods worth an estimated $3.5bn (£2.6bn) with Russia, despite tough sanctions and tariffs.
""Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,"" the foreign ministry statement said.
""The targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable,"" it added.
Last week, Trump had described India as a ""friend"" but said its tariffs on US products ""are far too high"" and he warned of an unspecified ""penalty"" over its trade with Russia.
His latest Truth Social post again struck a critical tone.
""India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits,"" he wrote.
""Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA,"" he added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not ordered India's oil refineries to stop buying Russian oil, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the situation.
Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official and head of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank, said Trump's claims about India's oil trade with Russia are misleading for several reasons.
He told the BBC that the trade has been transparent and broadly understood by the US.
Mr Srivastava said India ramped up purchases of oil to help stabilise global markets after Western sanctions disrupted supplies - helping to stop a global oil price shock.
He also said that India's oil refineries - both public and private - decide where to buy crude oil based on factors like price, supply security, and export rules. They operate independently of the government and do not need its approval to buy from Russia or other countries.
Though relations between the US and Russia warmed after Trump returned to the White house in January, the US president has more recently toughened his rhetoric against the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Trump has questioned whether Putin is truly committed to peace with Ukraine. In Monday's Truth Social post he used stern language, describing the Russian military as the ""Russian War Machine"".
Russia's leader has repeatedly said he is ready for peace but only if Kyiv meets certain conditions, such as recognising Ukrainian territories that Russia has occupied.
Trump has threatened Moscow with severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by 8 August.
US envoy Steve Witkoff is due to visit Russia later this week, where he is expected to meet Putin.

https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/india-recommends-import-tariffs-three-095434278.html,"(Reuters) -India has recommended a three-year import tariff of 11%-12% on some steel products to curb shipments from top producer China.
The levy, if imposed, will start at 12%. It will be eased to 11.5% in the second year and to 11% in the third year, the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) said in a notification dated August 16.
""The Authority concludes that there is a recent, sudden, sharp and significant increase in imports,"" the notification said, adding that this could cause serious injury to the domestic steel sector.
The DGTR also said that due to 50% tariffs on steel imports into the U.S., coupled with similar measures by other countries, a bulk of steel volumes are lying with manufacturers across the world.
""Therefore, the safeguard duty must address, not only the serious injury suffered by the domestic industry...but also the threat of serious injury that is likely to arise in the future.""
The final recommendation follows preliminary findings, after which the Indian government in April imposed a 12% temporary tariff for 200 days
Earlier on Monday, Japanese steel lobby groups said they have requested the early introduction of measures to prevent the evasion of anti-dumping tariffs aimed at protecting their domestic sector from unfair imports.
U.S. President Donald Trump's import tariffs on steel have fuelled a wave of trade frictions against Chinese steel, with countries including South Korea and Vietnam imposing anti-dumping levy.

https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-india-pauses-plans-buy-130716691.html,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - New Delhi has put on hold its plans to procure new U.S. weapons and aircraft, according to three Indian officials familiar with the matter, in India's first concrete sign of discontent after tariffs imposed on its exports by President Donald Trump dragged ties to their lowest level in decades.
India had been planning to send Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to Washington in the coming weeks for an announcement on some of the purchases, but that trip has been cancelled, two of the people said.
Trump on Aug. 6 imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods as punishment for Delhi's purchases of Russian oil, which he said meant the country was funding Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That raised the total duty on Indian exports to 50% - among the highest of any U.S. trading partner.
The president has a history of rapidly reversing himself on tariffs and India has said it remains actively engaged in discussions with Washington. One of the people said the defence purchases could go ahead once India had clarity on tariffs and the direction of bilateral ties, but ""just not as soon as they were expected to.""
Written instructions had not been given to pause the purchases, another official said, indicating that Delhi had the option to quickly reverse course, though there was ""no forward movement at least for now.""
Post publication of this story, India’s government issued a statement it attributed to a Ministry of Defence source describing news reports of a pause in the talks as ""false and fabricated."" The statement also said procurement was progressing as per ""extant procedures.""
Delhi, which has forged a close partnership with America in recent years, has said it is being unfairly targeted and that Washington and its European allies continue to trade with Moscow when it is in their interest.
Reuters is reporting for the first time that discussions on India's purchases of Stryker combat vehicles made by General Dynamics Land Systems and Javelin anti-tank missiles developed by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have been paused due to the tariffs.
Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in February announced plans to pursue procurement and joint production of those items.
Singh had also been planning to announce the purchase of six Boeing P8I reconnaissance aircraft and support systems for the Indian Navy during his now-cancelled trip, two of the people said. Talks over procuring the aircraft in a proposed $3.6 billion deal were at an advanced stage, according to the officials.
Boeing, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics referred queries to the Indian and U.S. governments. Raytheon did not return a request for comment.
RUSSIAN RELATIONS
India's deepening security relationship with the U.S., which is fuelled by their shared strategic rivalry with China, was heralded by many U.S. analysts as one of the key areas of foreign-policy progress in the first Trump administration.
Delhi is the world's second-largest arms importer and Russia has traditionally been its top supplier. India has in recent years however, shifted to importing from Western powers like France, Israel and the U.S., according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute think-tank.
The shift in suppliers was driven partly by constraints on Russia's ability to export arms, which it is utilizing heavily in its invasion of Ukraine. Some Russian weapons have also performed poorly in the battlefield, according to Western analysts.
The broader U.S.-India defence partnership, which includes intelligence sharing and joint military exercises, continues without hiccups, one of the Indian officials said.
India also remains open to scaling back on oil imports from Russia and is open to making deals elsewhere, including the U.S., if it can get similar prices, according to two other Indian sources.
Trump's threats and rising anti-U.S. nationalism in India have ""made it politically difficult for Modi to make the shift from Russia to the U.S.,"" one of the people said. Nonetheless, discounts on the landing cost of Russian oil have shrunk to the lowest since 2022.
India's petroleum ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
While the rupture in U.S.-India ties was abrupt, there have been strains in the relationship. Delhi has repeatedly rebutted Trump's claim that the U.S. brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after four days of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Trump also hosted Pakistan's army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.
In recent months, Moscow has been actively pitching Delhi on buying new defence technologies like its S-500 surface-to-air missile system, according to one of the Indian officials, as well as a Russian source familiar with the talks.
India currently does not see a need for new arms purchases from Moscow, two Indian officials said.
But Delhi is unlikely to wean itself off Russian weapons entirely as the decades-long partnership between the two powers means Indian military systems will continue to require Moscow's support, one of the officials said.
The Russian embassy in Delhi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/us-proceed-probe-solar-imports-210441652.html,"(Reuters) -The U.S. International Trade Commission voted on Friday to proceed with an investigation into whether solar panels from India, Laos and Indonesia are stifling domestic manufacturing, a key procedural step that could result in tariffs on those imports.
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
The unanimous decision by the three-member panel is a victory for domestic solar manufacturers who say Chinese companies with operations in those countries receive unfair government subsidies and are selling their products below the cost of production in the United States. U.S. producers are seeking to protect billions of dollars of investment in American factories.
KEY QUOTE
""Today's ITC decision confirms what our petitions allege: U.S. solar manufacturers are being undercut and harmed by unfairly traded imports. Chinese-owned and other companies in Laos, Indonesia, and India are gaming the system with unfair practices that are gutting U.S. jobs and investment,” said Tim Brightbill, lead counsel to the Alliance for American Solar Manufacturing and Trade and partner at Wiley Rein LLP.
CONTEXT
The case was brought in July by the alliance, a coalition of U.S. solar manufacturers including First Solar and Hanwha's Qcells.
Imports from India, Indonesia, and Laos surged to $1.6 billion last year, up from $289 million in 2022, according to the group. Many of these imports are believed to have shifted from countries already subject to U.S. tariffs on Southeast Asian solar exports.
WHAT’S NEXT
The U.S. Department of Commerce will continue investigations into the imports, with preliminary determinations on countervailing, or anti-subsidy, duties expected around Oct. 10 and on antidumping duties around Dec. 24.

Google today announced a new AI-powered tool ""designed for flexible travelers"" whose number one goal is to ""save money on their next trip."" Google says the new Flight Deals tool is built for people willing to play with different dates, destinations, and filters to save cash.
Powered by AI (likely Gemini), you can put in your query in natural language and simply describe where you want to go. Instead of entering a destination, dates, or other specifics, you could search for ""week-long trip this winter to a city with great food, nonstop only"" or ""10-day ski trip to a world-class resort,"" and Google Flights will find you the best deals available.
Google describes talking to Flight Deals ""as though you’re talking to a friend.""
Flight Deals lets you find low fares with just a few words
Google says Flight Deals will show ""best bargains"" that match your search and may even highlight destinations you might not have considered before putting in the query.
The company says this tool is specifically for travelers planning vacations without fixed dates or destinations. If this fits you, Flight Deals will tap into ""hundreds of airlines and booking sites"" to get you the best options. However, if you already know exactly where or when you want to go, Flight Deals may not be the best tool.
Flight Deals will be available within Google Flights in beta starting next week for users in the U.S., Canada, and India. The feature is not opt-in and will be available to all users in these regions.
You can access Flight Deals either by going directly to its dedicated page or via the top-left menu on Google Flights. The company will collect feedback on the tool and may roll it out to other regions based on responses.

https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-just-made-it-easier-to-see-stories-from-sites-you-trust,"Google Search introduces feature for prioritizing trusted news sources
Preferred Sources will push results from your chosen websites higher in Google Search.
What you need to know
- Google Search is adding a Preferred Sources feature to prioritize trusted websites.
- The feature is now available in India and the U.S. for English-language Google Search.
- Users can select sources from Top Stories, and Search will show them higher in the results.
Google is introducing a new feature in Search that will soon let you customize your experience to see websites you trust the most toward the top.
Despite introducing AI mode and features like Gemini Live, Google Search remains one of our go-to tools for finding anything on the internet. And while users have complained about Search being filled with Reddit posts, low-quality spam sites, and excessive sponsored content, Google is finally taking steps to improve things.
The company is rolling out what it calls Preferred Sources. As the name suggests, this feature lets you tell Google your favorite and most trusted websites.
Then, when you search for something and those sites have covered it, stories from those sources will appear in the Top Stories section. Articles from your trusted sources will also appear in a new ""From your sources"" section on the results page.
How to use Google's new Preferred Sources feature
For now, the Preferred Sources feature is available only in India and the U.S. for users searching in English. There's no official word on a wider rollout, but it will likely expand to other regions in the future. If you are in a supported region, though, it's simple to mark your preferred sources.
In Google Search, once you've searched for a news topic, click the icon to the right of the Top Stories section and select your Preferred Sources. You can also manually search for your favorite websites here. Once done, tap Refresh results, and the page will prioritize results from your trusted websites at the top.
Google says you will still see results from other websites, but this gives you a new way to customize Search.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
The feature was previously tested in Google Labs, and the company says users ""really value"" being able to choose their own sources, which is why it's now being made available to everyone, not just those part of the Labs program.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c98ln56494vo,"Bethell to become England's youngest men's captain
- Published
Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to captain England in international cricket when the 21-year-old leads an understrength T20 side on a tour of Ireland in September.
With regular white-ball captain Harry Brook and England's other all-format players rested, the leadership for three T20s in Dublin has been handed to all-rounder Bethell, who has had limited playing time this summer.
Monty Bowden was 23 years and 144 days old when he led England in a Test against South Africa in 1889, and to date remains the youngest man to have captained England in an international.
""It was obviously great news to hear,"" Bethell told BBC Sport.
""The first feeling was pride. It's not really sunk in yet. It's only been a few hours.
""I am looking forward to it and it'll be a huge honour to lead the team against Ireland.""
Prior to the Ireland tour, a full-strength England will play three one-day internationals and three T20s against South Africa.
Hampshire bowler Sonny Baker has been given a first call-up for the ODI series against South Africa and the T20 trip to Ireland.
Baker has impressed with his lively pace bowling in The Hundred, taking four wickets in four matches for Manchester Originals so far.
Fast bowler Mark Wood has been left out of all of the squads, having not played since February after knee surgery.
He had been targeting a return in the fifth Test against India earlier this month before a setback and his continued absence is a concern given his importance to England's hopes in the Ashes this winter.
England say they are prioritising Wood's winter schedule, though his recovery is taking longer than expected. Bowler Gus Atkinson has also been left out.
Brydon Carse, who skipped The Hundred to manage his workload, is included among the attack options for the South Africa ODI matches, along with Jofra Archer, Baker, Jamie Overton and Saqib Mahmood.
Leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed, who has also impressed domestically this summer, has been recalled to the squads which will be led by batter Brook.
Phil Salt returns to the T20 squads to face South Africa and Ireland after paternity leave.
Despite both holding central contracts, there is still no place for all-rounders Sam Curran or Liam Livingstone - even in the squad for the Ireland series when Brook, Archer, Carse, Joe Root, Ben Duckett and Jamie Smith are resting.
———————————————————
England ODI squad for South Africa: Harry Brook (capt), Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Sonny Baker, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler (wk), Brydon Carse, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Saqib Mahmood, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Jamie Smith (wk).
England T20 squad for South Africa: Harry Brook (capt), Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler (wk), Brydon Carse, Liam Dawson, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Saqib Mahmood, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Jamie Smith (wk), Luke Wood.
England T20 squad for Ireland: Jacob Bethell (capt), Rehan Ahmed, Sonny Baker, Tom Banton, Jos Buttler (wk), Liam Dawson, Tom Hartley, Will Jacks, Saqib Mahmood, Jamie Overton, Matthew Potts, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt (wk), Luke Wood.
———————————————————
The decision to name Bethell captain for the Ireland series is a remarkable show of faith.
England are huge admirers of his talents - he scored fifties in each of his first three Tests last year - but is yet to make a century in professional cricket.
His previous experience as captain has been with England Under-19s and Warwickshire's second XI. He has never captained at full senior level.
While Bethell will become England's youngest captain in an international, Alfred ""Bunny"" Lucas remains their youngest skipper in any match - having led an ""unrepresentative"" side against Gloucestershire aged just 20 in 1877.
""Jacob has impressed with his leadership qualities ever since he has been with the England squads and the series against Ireland will provide him with the opportunity to further develop those skills on the international stage,"" selector Luke Wright said.
Bethell added: ""I do try and lead by example but coming into the team as a youngster, you sometimes feel like it doesn't really have much of an impact.
""But it's nice to see they believe in what I can do and hopefully I can go out and show that I can.""
Bethell's summer has also been stop-start. He missed the one-off Test against Zimbabwe while at the Indian Premier League, with Ollie Pope retaking the number three position in his absence.
He then played three ODIs and three T20s against West Indies from late May but was an unused member of England's squad for the first four Tests against India.
When he was called in for the fifth Test after an injury to Ben Stokes, he had only played one red-ball match this year and returned scores of six and five.
He had a high score of eight in his first three Hundred matches but returned to form with 48 on Friday against Northern Superchargers.
Rather than picking him to play South Africa and Ireland, another option would have been for Bethell to play in Warwickshire's three County Championship matches in September as preparation for the Ashes, for which he is still expected to travel.
Instead, he will have only played 25 first-class matches in his career by the time the Ashes begins.

https://www.businessinsider.com/h-1b-visa-big-tech-immigration-green-card-2025-8,"The H-1B visa is a gateway to the American dream for skilled immigrants, but the path for some is paved with anxiety, guilt, and uncertainty.
Big Tech companies like Amazon, Meta, Google and Apple are among those allocated the highest number of these visas annually. And they can pay top dollar — sometimes as much as $500,000 — to secure talent, H-1B data reviewed by Business Insider shows.
The largest demographic of H-1B beneficiaries over the last decade has been Indian nationals working in computer-related roles, according to USCIS records.
Business Insider spoke to seven current or former H-1B recipients who moved from India and found work in Big Tech.
Their experiences reveal a program that grants access to life-changing opportunities and also imposes limitations that shape everything from career moves to family planning.
Tech layoffs, immigration policy shifts, and a booming Indian tech sector add to the daily pressure of living on this temporary visa in the United States.
For some, high salaries and career opportunities make the precarity worth it; for others, doubt is creeping in. These are their stories, as told to Business Insider.
The H-1B has allowed me to have a dream career, but it comes with uncertainty
Pushkar Singh, 31, is a staff engineer at Google, where he's worked in AI ads. He lives in California.
The H-1B visa has allowed me to continue my work in the US, but the biggest issue is the psychological toll.
I've been on an H-1B visa with Google for nearly seven years. My appetite for risk is lower because of my visa. Although you can switch jobs on an H-1B, you want to avoid moving to companies where there are high turnover rates to avoid getting fired.
You've contributed so much in work and taxes, but if you're laid off, you only have 60 days to find a new job. You don't have the luxury of waiting for the economy to improve before getting back into the job market.
I joined Google in Bangalore in 2015. I was interested in AI, but there weren't many opportunities in India. All the cutting-edge work was happening in Silicon Valley.
In 2017, the company relocated me to work on the ads team in California on an L-1 visa, which is for internal company transfers.
I wanted to switch to an H-1B visa to give me a bit more peace of mind because you can't really switch companies on an L-1. Google sponsored my petition, and I was selected in the H-1B lottery on the first attempt in 2018.
I've helped develop cool technologies for Google Ads, like PMax, which helps small businesses use AI for their advertising.
Alongside the psychological impact of being on an H-1B, there's also uncertainty around family.
My wife and I have to be mindful about starting a family or moving our parents here. If I lost my job, I might have to take my entire family back to India within 60 days.
I've seen misconceptions about the H-1B visa that it is replacing US jobs. Companies that hire a lot of H-1B workers have to give Americans fair opportunities for employment. I also get paid similarly to my US colleagues, so I don't think it's fair to say H-1B visa holders are cheap labor.
I support the H-1B program but also think it can be improved. Having part of the application process take the person's achievements into account, like other visas such as the O-1 or EB-1, could mean that good people don't miss out.
The H-1B has given me so many opportunities, but even after 12 years, my life in the US feels unstable and temporary
Surabhi Madan, 30, is a senior software engineer at Google. She lives in New York.
I've been with Google for eight years and am a senior software engineer. Now I'm in a phase of my life where I'm thinking more about long-term stability.
I enjoy my work, but there is an internal expectation to do well because, on an H-1B visa, my performance is the only thing in my hands.
I've thought about teaching full- or part-time, but I can't have a secondary job on an H-1B. A career change also seems challenging: I would have to return to a student visa to get a graduate degree, and salaries for high school teachers may not meet the minimum requirement for work visas.
I came to the US in 2013 to pursue a bachelor's at Brown. I interned at Google's New York office and landed a full-time offer before I graduated. I kicked off the process for my Optional Practical Training and received my H-1B visa in the lottery on my first try.
Once, after returning to the US from traveling abroad, a border officer asked me about the purpose of my visit. I said, ""I live here."" The officer responded, ""You don't live here; you work here."" I remember thinking, ""It's true.""
Even after more than a decade in the US, I have challenges that my friends don't. My life feels temporary in a lot of ways. I'm anxious about making mistakes when I drive or file taxes. I don't volunteer because I'd have to contact my immigration lawyer to check that it wouldn't jeopardize anything.
Friends are buying apartments and thinking about having families. I find it hard to put down roots. Every time I renew my apartment lease, I have the option for one or two years. I always choose one year.
My visa has become a consideration in family planning, too.
I've looked into egg freezing recently. But I had this vision of having to return as a tourist with a suitcase to pick up my eggs if my status changed, and decided it wasn't worth it. I also can't imagine having another person depend on me while on a temporary status tied to my job.
Once a year, I ask myself if this is still worth it. So far, the answer has been, ""yes.""
Living in the US has granted me so many opportunities; I'm grateful.
On the days I feel more anxious, I focus on the things in my control. I also have a decent financial cushion, another huge benefit of working in tech in the US for eight years.
I was laid off from Twitter on an H-1B visa. It was the worst season of my professional life.
Debpriya Seal, 40, lives in California. He was laid off from Twitter in 2022, leaving him with 60 days to find a new employer to sponsor his visa and remain in the US, per the program's restrictions.
In early November 2022, I got an email saying I'd been laid off. It was the worst season of my professional life.
I came to the US for a master's degree in 2012 and joined Twitter in data engineering four years later. Twitter transferred my H-1B visa from my previous company and sponsored my green card application, which is still pending.
Being laid off was emotional because I'd given six years to Twitter, but I didn't have much time to think about it. I had to find a new job before my visa ran out in 60 days.
The aggressive timeline felt like I was running down the clock. It was a constant dilemma to try to be prepared enough for interviews in a time crunch.
I looked for data and machine learning jobs, trying to get referrals from friends. I probably applied to around 50 companies overall.
Requiring a visa sponsorship probably made things harder for me. The first thing I'd say when speaking with HR departments of potential employers is that I'd require sponsorship. When you apply to Big Tech companies like Facebook, Apple, or Amazon, this generally isn't an issue. During the application process, a few companies told me they couldn't sponsor H-1Bs.
The market was tough. It was the last quarter of the year, when companies tend to slow hiring. I hoped I'd find a job in time, but I had to consider moving back to India. I started looking into selling my possessions on Facebook Marketplace.
After roughly a month, I was offered a staff software engineer position at Intuit. They filed for my H-1B transfer. I was so relieved. I've since moved to a role at LinkedIn.
Overall, my experience with the H-1B visa has mostly been positive. I can renew it and change companies relatively smoothly. There are just a few elements I'd say are unfair, like the fact that the lottery is basically a lucky draw, and the 60-day window if you get laid off.
I left the US to start my company and moved back. People on H-1Bs feel restricted from entrepreneurial ventures, and some are considering moving back to India.
Soundarya Balasubramani, 29, is the founder and CEO of The Curious Maverick LLC. She divides her time between San Francisco and Bengaluru, India.
I moved to the US on an F-1 visa to study at Columbia, then got a job at Salesforce, which sponsored my H-1B visa.
Salesforce, where I was a product manager from 2019 to 2021, had a comprehensive internal process for sponsoring my H-1B. I uploaded my passport and degree certificates to a portal and was later I was told I'd been selected in the lottery. Big companies also often have in-house legal counsel or partner law firms to handle immigration processes for employees.
In January 2023, I moved back to India to start a company focused on educational content and talent mobility. I felt I needed to move to become a founder. (My US work authorization meant I had to stay employed by the company that hired me.)
Coming back to the US was always part of my plan. I applied for an O-1 visa, which is for ""extraordinary individuals,"" with my own company sponsoring me. It was approved in 2023, and I moved back that October.
Getting an O-1 is much harder than getting an H-1B. The visa is for people at the top of their fields, so the burden of proof is pretty high. I had to submit evidence, such as awards, publications, and recommendations.
Although the American immigration system has problems, I can't imagine making the same kind of money anywhere else. My starting salary at Salesforce was $130,000, plus bonus and stocks. I could save aggressively and send money back home.
People on H-1Bs ask me about starting a side project. They have ideas, but feel like they can't execute them because of immigration restrictions.
India is booming, and I think people in the US are feeling a pull. They wonder if the green card backlog or constant fear of layoffs is worth it.
Indians on H-1Bs get criticism from two sides. Some people make negative statements about there being too many Indians in the US tech space, but there are also Indians who'll say you're propagating brain drain from India.
I founded a company on an H-1B. I have to be very careful how I approach it
Debjit Saha, 38, is the cofounder and CTO of HomeAbroad Inc., a real estate company in Buffalo, New York.
I started a company in the US as an H-1B visa holder. I have to follow the rules very carefully while running my business.
I came to the US in 2013 on a student visa for a master's in computer science. After finishing my studies, I started a full-time software engineer role at Oracle, where I worked until June 2021. They sponsored my H-1B.
While at Oracle, I had an idea for starting a business. My cofounder and I were discussing how immigrants struggle to get good mortgage rates because they lack credit history. We wanted to build a solution.
I relied on my employer for my H-1B visa status and was cautious of not violating my immigration status. Attorneys I consulted told me I could invest in the business but couldn't run its day-to-day operations. My cofounder was the CEO while I continued working for Oracle.
Eventually, I left the US in 2022 while our business, HomeAbroad, petitioned to transfer my H-1B.
To transfer my visa, our company had to show that it could pay me a salary that matched what those in similar occupations in our area made. We're a bootstrapped company, so my cofounder and I invested our own money in the company as working capital. My salary was then paid through operational revenue.
In 2023, I returned as the CTO.
As an H-1 B holder, I have to be careful to only do the type of work outlined in my petition. Even though I'm the cofounder, I can't do things outside my remit as CTO, like marketing.
It's a slippery slope, so it's always good to consult attorneys about whether you can take on a certain responsibility.
I've been following recent immigration debates and have tried to have a fallback plan. I'm looking into the EB-1 green card pathway.
The H-1B visa has helped me build a career in the US, and I feel fortunate to be building my company here. The Indian market is growing, but I think America is still the best place to get an education and enter the workforce.
I moved back to India after nearly 10 years. Visa challenges and the growing tech sector made the decision easier.
Vaashu Sharma is a senior software engineer at Airbnb, who moved from California to Bengaluru in November 2024.
I did my bachelor's in India and moved to the US in 2016 to pursue a master's in computer science at Stony Brook University.
After graduating, I landed a job at IBM. I got an offer from Meta a year later and worked there for four years. I was on a type of student work authorization called OPT for three years before I got my H-1B visa in my fourth attempt at the lottery. In 2022, I moved to Google for a new challenge.
Two years later, I moved to Bengaluru. Being closer to my family and the culture I grew up with was my biggest reason to move home. I was tired of missing celebrations and festivals.
I also felt Big Tech companies' presence had increased in India since I left. I saw positive changes in the products being built and salary potential.
Visa challenges also made my husband and me want to move home. We fell into different cycles for our three-year H-1B visa renewals.
While we were allowed to live and work in the US once our extension was approved, international travel became complicated. Once you leave the US on an old visa stamp, re-entry is only permitted with a renewed stamp. Post-pandemic, visa appointments were limited due to a significant backlog. Because it was so difficult to secure a slot in India to get new stamps, we weren't traveling back home.
We missed important events and were scared that if we ever got bad news about our family in India, we couldn't be there.
The H-1B also felt restrictive. We made good money and were growing our careers, but we couldn't pursue side hustles or take a career break.
And the worry that we could be deported was always there.
I landed a senior software engineer role at Airbnb in Bengaluru. Groceries can be delivered within 10 minutes, and we can afford to hire help with cooking and cleaning. The pros of living in India heavily outweigh the cons, like overcrowding or pollution.
H-1B challenges pushed me to move to Canada and become a citizen there, but it wasn't the end of all my problems
Sai Chiligireddy is an engineering manager at Amazon, where he works on Alexa. He lives in Seattle.
I came to the US in 2014 to pursue a master's at Texas A&M University.
I knew I could receive a longer period of student work authorization as a STEM major. Even if I didn't get an H-1B, I thought I'd have three years of solid work experience and could pay off any loans before moving back to India.
After graduation, I worked for a year and a half at Juniper Networks.
It was there, while trying for the H-1B lottery, that I heard about a Canadian visa program that gave applicants points based on their education, family ties, and work experience.
I moved to Canada after landing a software engineer position at Amazon — and three failed attempts at getting an H-1B in the lottery.
I loved my team in the Vancouver office, and the move boosted my career. But starting from scratch twice in five years was the most emotionally taxing thing I've ever done. I'm not an extrovert, so leaving my friends and family in the US and building new relationships was difficult.
I got citizenship after living in Canada for three years. Shortly after, I moved back to Seattle because my H-1B application was pulled in the lottery on my fourth try.
There are positives to living in the US as a Canadian citizen.
I feel less restricted than my Indian friends, who need to get their visas stamped overseas and spend their vacation time waiting for embassy appointments. Canadians are eligible for the North American Free Trade Agreement professional or ""TN"" visa, which I can fall back on if there are changes to the H-1B.
I still face challenges. The queue for green cards is based on the country of birth, and is exceptionally long for those born in India.
I'm still on H-1B, and even though I have more leeway than others, I make sure that I am giving 100% or more at work and try to ensure that I'm always providing value to the company so my job is safe.
My job would feel more like a job if I had a green card; now, it's what keeps me in the US.

https://gizmodo.com/this-newly-launched-satellite-just-bloomed-a-record-breaking-antenna-in-orbit-2000644290,"A first-of-its-kind satellite recently launched into orbit to monitor Earth’s changing surfaces, detecting movement of the planet’s crust down to fractions of an inch. The satellite packed a giant radar antenna, folded like an umbrella, and it just unfurled the massive, drum-shaped structure through an intricate process that brought it to full bloom.
The NISAR mission, a joint effort between NASA and the Indian space agency ISRO, launched on July 30 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in India. More than two weeks later, the satellite deployed its antenna reflector, which spans 39 feet (12 meters) wide—the largest ever used on a NASA mission. The team behind the mission began the process on August 9, unfolding the satellite’s boom one joint at a time and then firing a series of explosive bolts so that it could be deployed and locked into place in space.
“We were of course eager to see the deployment go well. It’s a critical part of the NISAR Earth science mission and has taken years to design, develop, and test to be ready for this big day,” Phil Barela, NISAR project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, said in a statement. “Now that we’ve launched, we are focusing on fine-tuning it to begin delivering transformative science by late fall of this year.”
NISAR, short for NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar, is designed to produce a three-dimensional view of Earth in unprecedented detail. The mission is equipped with the most sophisticated radar system for a NASA mission. The antenna reflector plays a key role for NISAR’s two synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, which use the motion of the radar antenna over its targeted area to create high-resolution images.
“Synthetic aperture radar, in principle, works like the lens of a camera, which focuses light to make a sharp image,” Paul Rosen, NISAR’s project scientist at JPL, said in a statement. “The size of the lens, called the aperture, determines the sharpness of the image.” The first radar system, L-band, can see through clouds and forest canopy. The second, an S-band system provided by ISRO, can see through clouds as well but is more sensitive to light vegetation and moisture in snow, according to NASA.
The reflector weighs about 142 pounds (64 kilograms) and comes with a cylindrical frame made of 123 composite struts and a gold-plated wire mesh. At the beginning of the process, NISAR’s boom began unfolding one joint at a time after being tucked in close to the satellite’s body. It took four days for it to become fully extended. On August 15, the team fired a series of small explosive bolts that held the reflector assembly in place to begin what NASA calls the “bloom” process. Through this process, the antenna unfurled by releasing tension stored in its flexible frame while it was tucked away like an umbrella. The team then activated motors and cables that pulled the antenna to its final form, blooming in its full glory.
The reflector is as wide as the length of a school bus, enabling NISAR to image Earth’s surface down to pixels about 30 feet (10 meters) across. “Using special interferometric techniques that compare images over time, NISAR enables researchers and data users to create 3D movies of changes happening on Earth’s surface,” Rosen said."
https://gizmodo.com/apples-tim-cook-talks-trump-tariffs-and-ai-2000637963,"On Thursday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the Silicon Valley company could end up spending nearly $2 billion thanks to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
“For the June quarter, we incurred approximately $800 million of tariff-related costs,” Cook told investors on an earnings call. He added that the company expects those costs to climb to $1.1 billion in the quarter ending in September if Trump’s tariff policies remain unchanged. As Apple watchers know, that’s the same month when the new round of iPhones (and their prices) will be announced.
Trump’s tariff policies have affected all of Apple’s devices, which are manufactured primarily in China, India, and Vietnam. Since the beginning of his second term, Trump has used the threat of tariffs to pressure Apple and other American companies to shift production back to the U.S. In an effort to appease Trump, Apple said it is launching a manufacturing academy in Detroit later this year. The project is tied to the company’s plan to invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years.
Even with the added costs, Apple still managed to boost revenue 10% year-over-year in the quarter, reaching $94 billion.
On the AI front, Cook told investors that Apple plans to “significantly” increase its investments in artificial intelligence, as it tries to catch up with its rivals. He said that the company is open to acquisitions that could accelerate those efforts.
Apple wasn’t the only company to talk about AI this week during its earnings report.
Amazon also reported earnings on Thursday, revealing the scale of its AI spending. The e-commerce giant poured $31.4 billion into capital expenses last quarter and expects a similar pace in the second half of the year. CEO Andrew Jassy also highlighted Alexa+, a premium version of its digital assistant, as one way the company could further monetize AI with ads.
“People do a lot of shopping [with Alexa+]; it’s a delightful shopping experience that will keep getting better,” Jassy said on a call with investors. “I think over time, there will be opportunities, as people are engaging in more multi-turn conversations, to have advertising play a role to help people find discovery, and also as a lever to drive revenue.”
For Microsoft, its AI bets are already paying off in a big way. After reporting earnings this week, the software giant joined Nvidia as the only companies in history to reach a $4 trillion market cap. Revenue for the latest quarter rose 18% to $64 billion, driven largely by growth in its cloud computing services.
Despite its financial success, Microsoft recently cut thousands of jobs. In a company-wide memo, CEO Satya Nadella described this tension as the “enigma of success,” noting that the company is posting record profits even as it laid off 9,000 workers earlier this month."
https://www.xataka.com/empresas-y-economia/india-apisonadora-economica-geopolitica-no-nueva-china-su-estrategia-para-crecer-inedita,"India está emergiendo. Este país asiático, el más poblado del planeta, tiene una capacidad económica y una relevancia geopolítica muy importantes. Según el Fondo Monetario Internacional, su economía es una de las que más rápido están creciendo, con una previsión de expansión del 6,2% en 2025 y del 6,3% para 2026. Otras grandes economías, como EEUU o China, están revisando a la baja su previsión de crecimiento para 2025 y 2026, pero India no. Avanza día tras día como una auténtica apisonadora.
Uno de los pilares que sostienen su crecimiento económico es su consumo doméstico. El 31% de su población, que actualmente roza los 1.464 millones de personas, tiene un nivel medio de ingresos, y las previsiones del Gobierno indio estiman que este porcentaje se incrementará hasta alcanzar el 38% en 2031. Si persiste esta tendencia en 2047 la clase media en India aglutinará a nada menos que 1.000 millones de personas. No obstante, el auténtico motor del crecimiento de este país, y la razón por la que la clase media se está expandiendo, es la política de incentivos vinculados a la producción que ha desplegado la Administración.
Esta estrategia persigue desarrollar y modernizar las capacidades de fabricación de India, así como impulsar las exportaciones. Y está funcionando. Desde que el Gobierno lo puso en marcha en marzo de 2020, este plan ha generado 1,15 millones de puestos de trabajo. Y, además, ha impactado de una forma muy positiva en los siguientes sectores clave: la electrónica, los coches eléctricos, los sistemas integrados y de automatización industrial, los productos farmacéuticos y biotecnológicos, los drones, los centros de datos y los productos químicos. En ellos reside la fortaleza de este país.
India quiere ser la nueva Taiwán en la industria de los semiconductores
Uno de los sectores que más alegrías está dando a India durante los últimos años es el dedicado a la fabricación de productos electrónicos. En 2024 facturó 115.000 millones de dólares, y el Gobierno prevé que esta cifra se triplicará en 2027. Este enorme impulso se sostiene principalmente sobre el programa Semicon India, que persigue desarrollar drásticamente la relevancia de India en la industria de la fabricación de circuitos integrados. Para lograrlo este plan persigue sobre todo atraer inversión extranjera, y durante los últimos años está yendo como la seda.
India se está preparando para ser un actor muy relevante en la industria de los semiconductores
Apple, Amazon, Google o Microsoft son algunas de las grandes compañías de tecnología que ya están presentes en India. Y AMD y Foxconn lo estarán pronto. Es evidente que este país puja fuerte, y, según DigiTimes Asia, se está preparando para ser un actor muy relevante en la industria de los semiconductores en una coyuntura que a medio o largo plazo puede desfavorecer a Taiwán. Según la consultora Deloitte el mercado de los circuitos integrados de India rebasará los 55.000 millones de dólares en 2026, y para lograrlo el Gobierno pretende atraer a tantos fabricantes de chips como pueda.
La compañía estadounidense Micron Technology, que se dedica sobre todo a la fabricación de chips de memoria, tendrá un rol muy importante en el futuro de la industria de los semiconductores de India. Y lo tendrá debido a que ha puesto en marcha una planta de vanguardia en la localidad de Sanand, que pertenece al estado de Gujarat. Aun así, según Eric Chen, que es un analista e investigador de la industria de los circuitos integrados, India tardará una década en alcanzar la producción masiva de chips de 28 nm. A esto es a lo que aspira a medio plazo. Su principal desafío es poner a punto con agilidad las plantas necesarias para alcanzar este objetivo, y una fábrica de chips de vanguardia tarda no menos de cuatro años en estar plenamente operativa.

Este artículo refleja un profundo desconocimiento de ese país.
En realidad la inversión extranjera está estancada por la tremenda inseguridad jurídica y corrupción del país. Sus infraestructuras son desastrosas y más de la mitad de su población sigue muy por debajo del nivel de pobreza, aparte de que la mitad de su población sigue siendo analfabeta.
Su sistema de castas (en teoría abolido) sigue estando muy presente y condena a 400 millones de personas a la miseria más absoluta.
India está muy lejos de ser la nueva China. Está incluso muy lejos de ser el nuevo Vietnam.

Juan Carlos mira que nunca pensaba que diría esto pero aunque a veces haces textos sensacionalistas este además es poco riguroso porque te saltas millones de factores políticos que están afectando al país que mencionas.
La diferencia entre India y China es mucho más profunda y tiene que ver con su constitución socio-política.
Los modelos de desarrollo de China e India suelen ser etiquetados como ""capitalismo de Estado"" y ""democracia de mercado"" respectivamente. Sin embargo, estos títulos son engañosos y no reflejan la realidad detrás de su éxito o fracaso en la lucha contra la pobreza. El modelo de China: denominado capitalismo de Estado es en en realidad para ser más exactos un comunismo con rasgos capitalistas.
China ha logrado sacar a millones de personas de la pobreza a una velocidad sin precedentes. Este éxito se atribuye a un sistema que, aunque utiliza herramientas capitalistas como la inversión privada y los mercados, mantiene un rasgo fundamentalmente anticapitalista y comunista: que no es más que la propiedad estatal de la tierra.
El gobierno chino, al ser el dueño de la tierra, puede tomar decisiones estratégicas de desarrollo sin los obstáculos de la propiedad privada. Esto le permite planificar y ejecutar proyectos masivos de infraestructura (carreteras, ferrocarriles, redes eléctricas) de forma rápida y eficiente. Aunque los ciudadanos tienen derechos de uso y pueden heredar las propiedades construidas, el control del Estado sobre la tierra es lo que permite una planificación a largo plazo y una movilización de recursos a una escala que no se ve en otros sistemas. El título de ""capitalismo"" confunde, ya que el motor de su desarrollo reside en un control estatal de los recursos clave, y sectores estratégicos como es la energía la vivienda la seguridad, la educación, donde el estado tiene un control sobre ello no estando todo esto privatizado sino donde el estado tiene una inversión y control. Se habla mucho con los problemas que hemos tenido en España de que la producción de energía no debería de estar en manos de un oligopolio de empresas privadas porque pueden y han hecho lo que pasó con el apagón o poner la electricidad al precio que ellos quieran cuando puede ser mucho más económico y accesible para todo el mundo. Si la gente no tiene casas para vivir no tiene energía para hacer de comer o no morirse de frío o calor pues es poca seguridad que da un estado y la igualdad para vivir en condiciones con un mínimo de calidad.
El modelo de India llamado ¿democracia de mercado realmente lo que favorece es el privilegio de castas. Como sucede en todos nuestros países occidentales. Lo que pasa que allí está todavía muchos más agudizado porque siempre han sido un pueblo colonizado y no colonizador como los países occidentales donde la expoliación de recursos ha permitido que sociedades occidentales a pesar de las castas hay un bienestar mínimo para una gran cantidad de gente.
En contraste, el progreso de la India ha sido mucho más lento y desigual. El título de ""democracia de mercado"" es preciso en cuanto a que existen elecciones libres (que esto también se puede debatir teniendo en cuenta que hoy en día se pueden dar golpes de estados en democracias manipulando redes sociales y medios de comunicación como bien haciendo Estados Unidos en todo el mundo haciendo que los distintos países estén alineados a sus intereses o directamente sean marionetas). El título que se le da a India para definir su sociedad ignora la realidad de una profunda desigualdad social y económica.
El principal impedimento para un desarrollo acelerado es la propiedad privada de la tierra, que es un pilar del capitalismo. La protección legal de este derecho en la India genera un proceso de expropiación muy lento, sujeto a litigios y protestas de los ciudadanos y los agricultores. Esto frena el desarrollo de infraestructuras vitales para el progreso.
Además, la estructura social de la India, con un sistema de castas persistente, se alinea con este modelo, concentrando los beneficios del desarrollo en las élites y las castas más ricas. El resultado es un modelo que, aunque se llama ""democrático"", perpetúa la desigualdad y utiliza un sistema de propiedad privada que beneficia a unos pocos, lo que va en contra del desarrollo colectivo y la erradicación de la pobreza a gran escala.
En resumen, la clave no está en los títulos ideológicos, sino en la diferencia real en la propiedad de la tierra y en el papel del Estado. China utiliza un sistema de propiedad estatal para un desarrollo rápido y centralizado, mientras que India, con su protección de la propiedad privada, se enfrenta a un desarrollo más lento y desigual. Por mucha inversión extranjera que se esté metiendo ahora mismo en India para intentar desestabilizar a China. Si no hubiera esta impresión por parte de Occidente para intentar desestabilizar a China India ahora mismo seguiría como hace 20 años. En el caso de China la inversión fue activa desde el propio Gobierno chino que empezó con las reformas de Deng Xiaoping en 1978. En India es más un interés de Occidente.

El principio de que para que existan ricos tiene que haber pobres alcanza su máxima expresión en la India. Pueden poner un cohete en la luna a la vez que ""los intocables"" viven igual que animales sin que otras castas se dignen ni a tocarlos físicamente.

El problema de castas es notorio, esto influye a nivel cultural que solo estan alli unidos por los lideres, sino serian pueblos remotos mas del monton. Mas aun, su salubridad es consecuencia del pesimo sistema de castas.
Y los de arriba pensando que 1000 millones son demasiados y que solo debe haber 50 a lo sumo, los de abajo piensan que los de arriba no pueden tenerlo todo y los quieren fuera. No hay cohesion, no hay trabajo en equipo. Y eso le costara caro a India a futuro.

An anonymous reader shares a report: India's blueprint for displacing China as the world's electronics workshop contains a rather extraordinary feature: the entire Indian edifice requires Chinese companies to supply the technical architecture, manufacturing know-how and operational templates that would make such displacement theoretically possible.
Let's start with Dixon Technologies, India's flagship domestic electronics manufacturer. The company has systematically built indigenous capability through a growing constellation of Chinese partnerships: Longcheer provides the design intelligence, Kunshan Q-Tech delivers camera module expertise, Chongqing Yuhai supplies precision-molded components and HKC brings display technology. This pattern of structured dependence has become the organizing principle of India's electronics manufacturing push.
[...] The current architecture sees Chinese companies retain control of the critical knowledge while their Indian partners provide labour arbitrage and regulatory navigation. Under this arrangement, India isn't constructing an alternative to Chinese manufacturing so much as establishing Chinese manufacturing's most elaborate subsidiary operation, underwritten by Indian taxpayers and marketed as national renewal. Many countries, but most importantly India and Vietnam, have worked hard in recent years to attract businesses that decided to diversify away from China, a strategy analysts have dubbed as ""China Plus One.""
