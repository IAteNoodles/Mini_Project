    "Definition: A sustained pattern in news coverage where editorial decisions consistently favor or disadvantage particular political actors, parties, policies, or ideologies, shaping the narrative to align with specific political interests. Evidenced by the deliberate inclusion of supportive evidence, expert commentary, or success stories for one side, while minimizing, omitting, or discrediting opposing viewpoints through selective sourcing and context removal. Reflected in the disproportionate allocation of visibility—such as longer articles, prominent headlines, and rich multimedia elements—to narratives that bolster certain political agendas, creating an imbalanced portrayal of issues. Detected through systematic analysis of framing devices, such as loaded language that casts one policy as \"transformative reform\" while labeling its alternative as \"misguided proposal,\" thereby guiding reader interpretation along partisan lines.\n",

Manifests as chronic underrepresentation of women, nonbinary, and transgender individuals in bylines, quotes, and expert analyses, implicitly signaling that certain genders are less authoritative or credible. Revealed through language choices that mark one gender with relational identifiers (e.g., \"the CEO and her husband\") or diminish professional roles by emphasizing appearance, family status, or emotional attributes for women, while exclusively highlighting credentials and achievements for men. Identified by the inconsistent use of neutral job titles and honorifics—referring to a \"nurse\" by gendered pronouns but omitting gender markers for equivalent male roles—thereby perpetuating assumptions about default gender roles in various professions.\n",

Appears through ethnocentric descriptions that label non-dominant traditions as \"primitive,\" \"superstitious,\" or \"exotic spectacle,\" without providing the historical, social, or theological context necessary for nuanced understanding. Evident in the omission of voices from the community being described—such as tribal elders or minority religious scholars—resulting in one-sided narratives that privilege the dominant group's interpretations and values.

Characterized by thematic prioritization of issues resonating with the ideology—such as framing economic debates exclusively around market freedom or social justice—while systematically excluding data, expert opinions, or narratives that challenge the chosen worldview. Revealed through narrative arc construction that foregrounds sources committed to the preferred ideology—quoting think-tank analysts, opinion leaders, or advocacy groups aligned with that stance—while marginalizing or omitting voices from alternative philosophical traditions.
