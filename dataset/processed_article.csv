5,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g614x9kqko,"Katy Watson, BBC News in Kyiv, and Danai Nesta Kupemba, BBC News: After of Russian on Zizhzhia Authorities have reported that Russia executed a significant overnight assault impacting 14 regions of Ukraine, while Kyiv retaliated by targeting Russian oil refineries. In the southern Zaporizhzhia area, one woman lost her life and 30 individuals, including children, sustained injuries, as per local officials. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky indicated that Russia deployed nearly 540 drones and 45 missiles, calling for stringent new sanctions against Moscow. In the wake of the attack, Russia's defense ministry claimed that all ""objectives of the strike have been accomplished"" and that ""designated targets have been struck,"" a statement that has not been independently confirmed. Russia initiated its extensive invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This latest wave of assaults occurs amidst ongoing global endeavors to broker a peace agreement between the conflicting nations, just days after Kyiv experienced the second largest aerial bombardment of the conflict, resulting in at least 25 fatalities. In the southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, senior official Serhiy Lysak reported multiple strikes on infrastructure facilities following a ""massive"" overnight drone and missile attack. In the regional capital, Dnipro, a residential building was entirely demolished, and a shopping center suffered damage, according to Lysak. While no casualties were reported from the overnight strikes, Lysak mentioned that four individuals were injured during a Russian drone attack on Saturday afternoon. This marks the second consecutive night that Dnipropetrovsk had been targeted. Earlier in the week, Kyiv acknowledged that Russian forces had penetrated the region and were attempting to establish a presence. Firefighters worked to extinguish fires in Zaporizhzhia during the early hours of Saturday.","Russia launched a large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine, hitting 14 regions and causing deaths and injuries.

This incident marks a significant challenge for President Prabowo Subianto's administration.

The disaster management agency released a statement but did not specify the reasons behind the fatalities related to the fire that occurred on Friday evening in Makassar, South Sulawesi province. According to the Antara news agency, the deceased were reportedly trapped inside the engulfed structure. The disaster agency noted that two injuries were due to individuals jumping from the building.

Protests commenced in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, earlier this week concerning lawmakers' salaries, intensifying on Friday when a police armored vehicle struck and killed a ride-hailing motorbike driver. Prabowo, who assumed office in October of the previous year, visited the driver's home late Friday, expressing condolences to the family and pledging to ensure a thorough investigation into the incident.

Local news outlets reported sporadic looting in Jakarta and damage to various transportation facilities on Friday, along with demonstrations in significant cities like Bandung and Yogyakarta. On Saturday, Jakarta's mass rapid transit system announced that trains would not be stopping at a station close to the protest site from the previous day, while the Transjakarta bus service indicated it was unable to provide service to passengers. No immediate indications of protests were observed on Saturday.","Rioters in Indonesia set fire to a regional parliament building, resulting in three deaths and five injuries.

Israel stated that the strike targeted top officials of the Iran-backed group, while Houthi sources confirmed the deaths of the ministers of energy, foreign affairs, and information. The prime minister, Ahmad Ghaleb al-Rahwi, was considered largely symbolic within the Houthi leadership. After the incident, Houthi officials pledged to continue resistance against Israel.

9,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g614x9kqko,"Russia has carried out a massive overnight attack on 14 regions of Ukraine, authorities have said, as Kyiv struck Russian oil refineries. One woman was killed in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and 30 people were injured - including children - according to local officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched nearly 540 drones and 45 missiles, urging tough new sanctions on Moscow. Following the attack, Russia's defence ministry said all ""targets of the strike have been achieved"" and ""designated objects have been hit"" - a claim that has not been independently verified. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The latest barrage comes amid ongoing international efforts to secure a peace deal between the two warring nations - and days after the Ukrainian capital Kyiv faced the second largest aerial attack of the war so far, with at least 25 killed. In the south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, top official Serhiy Lysak reported a number of strikes on infrastructure facilities and after a ""massive"" drone and missile overnight attack. In the regional capital Dnipro, a residential house was completely destroyed and a shopping centre was damaged, Lysak said. No casualties were reported in the overnight strikes, but Lysak later said four people were injured in a Russian drone attack on Saturday afternoon. It is the second successive night Dnipropetrovsk has been targeted. Earlier this week, Kyiv acknowledged that Russia's military had entered the region and was trying to establish a foothold. Railway infrastructure was damaged near the capital, Kyiv, but it was central and south-eastern Ukraine that bore the brunt of the latest strikes. Emergency services were seen putting out fires in Zaporizhzhia, while explosions were heard in the central eastern regions. Meanwhile, Ukraine's military said its drones hit oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran in Russia overnight. Both refineries have been targeted before. The Ukrainian military said there had been ""numerous"" explosions and fires recorded at the facility in Krasnodar, which Kyiv said produces three million tons of petroleum products per year. The military also reported a fire at the Syzran facility, which it said produced eight-and-a-half million tons of petroleum products annually. Russian authorities in Krasnodar acknowledged the drone strikes had hit its oil refinery. They said one of the process units was damaged and a fire occurred in the area, adding that there had been no casualties. The Russian defence ministry said it had shot down 20 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 18 over the Crimean Peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Moscow annexed in 2014. The Russian military also said it captured Komyshevakha, a rural settlement in the eastern Donetsk region, on Saturday morning. Ukraine has not confirmed this. In recent months, Russian troops have continued their slow advance in eastern Ukraine, despite heavy combat casualties being reported. The chief of Russia's general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said on Saturday that his forces were continuing ""their non-stop offensive along almost the entire line of contact"". Friday night's aerial exchange follows US-led diplomatic efforts aimed at ending the war, which so far remain at a standstill. Zelensky said the latest attacks showed Russia's ""disregard for words"", adding that the only way to deal with Russia was to impose sanctions. ""We expect action from the US, Europe and the entire world,"" he said. European foreign affairs ministers are in Denmark this weekend to discuss international developments - including the war in Ukraine. One of the key issues on the table is the possibility of freezing approximately €210bn (£182bn; $245bn) worth of Russian assets. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, who is at the gathering, said it was clear ""Russia does not want peace"" despite diplomatic efforts. France would use the gathering to table new proposals for sanctions against Russia, with the aim of depleting ""the resources that Russia is investing in this war"" - Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot was quoted by Russia's state-owned news agency Tass as saying.","Russia conducted a large-scale overnight assault on 14 Ukrainian regions, killing one and injuring thirty, mostly in Zaporizhzhia. President Zelensky called for tougher sanctions following the attack. Russia claimed all targets were hit, though these claims were unverified. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, critical infrastructure and residences were damaged by missiles and drones, and a residential building in Dnipro was destroyed. Ukraine retaliated by hitting Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran, causing fires and damaging facilities, which Russian officials acknowledged. Russia also reported shooting down 20 Ukrainian drones and capturing a settlement in Donetsk, though Ukraine did not confirm this.

At least one person was killed and 30 others wounded in Ukraine's Zaporizhia region, while residential buildings were hit and scores of homes left without gas or electricity. The cities of Dnipro and Pavlohrad in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk also came under attack early on Saturday, causing fires. Ukraine's Air Force said it had downed 510 of 537 drones and 38 of 45 missiles launched by Russia in the overnight attack. In Ukraine's Kherson, a 74-year-old man was also killed when Russian forces shelled the city, according to officials. The chief of Russia's general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said that Russian forces are waging a nonstop offensive along almost the entire front line in Ukraine and have the ""strategic initiative"". In a speech to his deputies, Gerasimov also said that Russian forces now control 99.7% of Ukraine's Luhansk region, 79% of the Donetsk region, 74% of the Zaporizhia region and 76% of the Kherson region and almost completely blockaded the city of Kupiansk, controlling about half of its area. Ukrainian military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said that Kyiv's forces had scored front-line successes, keeping Russian troops from seizing targets in Donetsk and halting advances into Dnipropetrovsk region. Ukraine's military also claimed attacks in Russia, striking oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran, setting off fires at both facilities. Russia's TASS state news agency said Ukrainian shelling left over 17,000 without power in Russia's Kursk region. The Russian Ministry of Defence said its forces shot down 233 Ukrainian drones, one guided bomb, and four missiles in 24 hours. President Zelenskyy accused the Kremlin of using peace talks preparation time to organize new attacks and called for more sanctions on Moscow. Indian PM Modi reaffirmed support for peace by phone with Zelenskyy.

Israeli media reported the army attacked the Houthi cabinet, including the prime minister and 12 ministers. Earlier Israeli strikes killed 10 people and wounded more than 90 in Sanaa. The Israeli military said it targeted Houthi military sites and the presidential palace. Al Jazeera's Hamdah Salhut reported Israel will continue targeting Houthi-related sites, meaning military and political sites.

The attack came amid ongoing Gaza conflict and regional escalation.","Israeli airstrikes on Sanaa killed Yemen's Houthi prime minister and several ministers amid escalating regional tensions.

By Susan Heavey
August 30, 2025
9:46 PM UTC

WASHINGTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Chicago police will not collaborate with any National Guard troops or federal agents if U.S. President Donald Trump deploys them to the city in coming days as threatened, Mayor Brandon Johnson said on Saturday.

The Democratic mayor, surrounded by other city leaders, signed an executive order aimed at preparing Chicago for any U.S. enforcement operation as Trump has done in Los Angeles and Washington, and urged the Republican president to reverse course.

""This is about making sure that we are prepared,"" he told reporters as he signed the order, adding that the order aimed to offer ""real, clear guidance"" to city government workers and ""all the Chicagoans of how we can stand up against this tyranny.""

The executive order says that Chicago police officers will continue to enforce state and local laws but will not assist with any patrols, arrests or other law enforcement actions alongside federal officers, including the National Guard.

It also directs city police to wear their official police uniforms, continue to identify themselves, follow body camera procedures and not to wear masks to clearly distinguish themselves from any federal operations, according to a copy of the order.

""The deployment of federal military forces in Chicago without the consent of local authorities undermines democratic norms, violates the City's sovereignty, threatens civil liberties, and risks escalating violence rather than securing the peace,"" the order says.

Trump has been threatening to expand his federal crackdown on Democrat-led U.S. cities to Chicago, casting the use of presidential power as an urgent effort to tackle crime even as city officials cite declines in homicides, gun violence and burglaries.

Local officials and residents in Chicago, the nation's third largest city, have been preparing for the possible arrival of federal agents and troops, and Johnson said they have received credible reports that action could come within days.

The White House dismissed Johnson's move and accused Democrats of trying to make tackling crime a partisan issue.

""If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement.

While it is unclear how much state and local officials can do to push back against any U.S. deployment, the mayor said he was pursuing any legal and legislative measures available, including possible lawsuits.

""We will use the courts if that's necessary,"" Johnson said.

Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly said he wants to be asked for federal agents to be deployed to various cities even as he continues to threaten to send them anyway without any formal request.

Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat whose name has also been floated as a possible 2028 presidential candidate, has said the president lacks the legal authority to deploy troops to his state if not requested by the governor.

That differs from Washington, a federal city whose police department Trump took over.

Previous deployments of the National Guard to Chicago were coordinated with local officials. A president's power to send in troops is limited under U.S. law, but there are no restrictions on the deployment of federal law enforcement officers such as ICE agents.

Reporting by Susan Heavey and Andrea Shalal; Editing by Richard Chang and Nick Zieminski","Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing city police not to collaborate with federal troops or agents if President Trump follows through on threats to deploy them to the city, which Johnson called ""tyranny."" The order, issued amid credible reports of imminent federal action, prohibits local police from assisting in patrols, arrests, or enforcement activities with federal officers or the National Guard, while requiring officers to wear uniforms, use body cameras, and avoid masks to clearly distinguish themselves. Johnson argues such deployments violate local sovereignty, threaten civil liberties, and risk escalating violence. While crime in Chicago has been declining, Trump cites public safety to justify federal intervention, similar to actions in L.A. and D.C. The White House dismissed Johnson’s order as a “publicity stunt,” but Johnson said he is prepared to pursue legal and legislative action. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker added that Trump lacks the authority to deploy military forces without state consent, though federal agents like ICE can still be sent.

The United States takes center stage with the release of crucial jobs data that could influence Federal Reserve policy decisions in the coming months. Economists are closely watching employment figures as the central bank weighs its next moves amid ongoing inflation concerns and economic uncertainty.

Meanwhile, China is set to host a series of significant diplomatic summits with world leaders, marking a potential shift in international relations. These meetings come at a time of heightened global tensions and could reshape trade relationships and geopolitical alliances.

In Europe, France faces mounting political turmoil as domestic challenges threaten government stability. The situation has drawn international attention and could have broader implications for European Union cohesion and policy direction.

Brazil adds another layer of complexity to the global landscape with a high-profile trial capturing worldwide attention. The proceedings are expected to have far-reaching consequences for the country's political and economic future.

Market analysts are particularly focused on upcoming Federal Reserve decisions, which could trigger significant movement across global financial markets. The central bank's policy stance will likely influence investment flows and currency valuations worldwide.

International power plays continue to evolve as nations navigate complex diplomatic relationships. These developments are occurring against a backdrop of shifting global alliances and emerging economic partnerships.

The growing impact of tariffs remains a critical factor in international trade discussions. Businesses and governments alike are adjusting strategies to accommodate changing trade policies and their cascading effects on global commerce.

The Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up here.

Wall Street indexes continue to grind out new records as Federal Reserve doves push for an interest rate cut next month, but stock futures stepped back ahead of today's bell as inflation and trade updates were awaited and the Fed board row intensified.

Just before the long Labor Day weekend, the July reading on the Fed's favored inflation gauge - the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure - is due for release on Friday along with goods trade data for the same month. Annual core PCE inflation is expected to have ticked up to 2.9%, although it will arguably be overshadowed by the more sensitive August payrolls report next week.

* Chiming with White House demands, dovish Fed board governor Chistopher Waller - tipped by many to be the next Fed Chair - said that rates needed to be cut next month and that if August jobs and inflation readouts were soft enough then more than a quarter point reduction may be warranted. There was little to support that from Thursday's data at least, with Q2 GDP revised up to show 3.3% growth and weekly jobless claims ebbing. Fed futures price an 84% chance of a quarter point cut in September, with 55 basis points of cuts pencilled in by yearend. Treasury yields backed up slightly from Thursday's lows and the dollar firmed a touch.

* Waller's Fed board colleague Lisa Cook filed a lawsuit on Thursday claiming President Donald Trump has no power to remove her from office, setting up a legal battle that could challenge long-established norms for the U.S. central bank's independence. Cook also sought an injunction that declares Trump's effort to fire her is unlawful and seeks to bar the Fed from taking steps to remove her pending further litigation. A hearing on the motion is set for 1000 EDT on Friday. If successful, it would allow Cook - who has always voted in step with the majority of Fed governors - to take part in September's policy meeting.

* Elsewhere, the U.S. tariff exemption for package shipments valued under $800 ended on Friday, raising costs and disrupting supply chain models for e-commerce companies, small businesses using online marketplaces and consumers. The European Commission, meanwhile, proposed removing duties on imported U.S. industrial goods in return for reduced U.S. tariffs on European cars. China stocks outperformed and were on course for their biggest monthly gain in almost a year, despite a pullback in its red-hot tech sector and a cooling of the yuan from 2025 highs. British banks fell 3-5% after a UK think tank recommended the government tax banks on the billions of pounds they receive in interest from the Bank of England on the reserves.

Today's Market Minute
* The U.S. tariff exemption for package shipments valued under $800 ended on Friday, raising costs and disrupting supply chain models for e-commerce companies, small businesses using online marketplaces and consumers alike.
* The Indian rupee hit a record low on Friday, slipping past the 88-per-dollar mark for the first time ever, as investors said the drag from punitive U.S. tariffs on Indian goods will hurt the country's growth and external finances.
* Thailand's Paetongtarn Shinawatra has been dismissed as prime minister by the Constitutional Court for a violation of ethics after only a year in power, plunging the country and its stuttering economy into more uncertainty.
* Amid the Federal Reserve drama and deluge of corporate earnings in August, one clear but overlooked trend emerged in U.S. equities: the rotation out of expensive tech stocks and into cheaper small caps. As the month draws to a close, ROI markets columnist Jamie McGeever writes, the big question is whether this can continue.
* The world is going to need a lot of copper and other critical metals if it is going to pivot away from fossil fuels. But, ROI metals columnist Andy Home asks: can the mining industry deliver?

Weekend reads
* OVERHEATING OR SKEW?: U.S. Census Bureau numbers showing 2.2 million fewer foreign-born adults in July versus January are ""almost certainly wrong"", argues Peterson Institute fellow Jed Kolko, adding they are either incorrect or suggest a ludicrously overheated labor market with a jobless rate as low as 2.6%. Kolko explains that some or most of the decline is probably because immigrants are increasingly wary of responding to government surveys. The drop in immigrants is still very real and large - just not that large, he concludes.
* LOWER JOBS BREAKEVEN: Falling net migration has likely cut by two thirds the 'breakeven' monthly payroll benchmark - the number of jobs the economy needs to add to keep the jobless rate steady, reckons St. Louis Fed economist Alexander Bick. Data from the last three months suggests a breakeven below 50,000 and if employment growth is revised downward again when the August jobs report is released on Sept 5, ""it would support the low end of our estimate range - 32,000 jobs - being closer to the mark"".
* TRUST EROSION AND HAWKISH CUT: Former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson says the Trump administration's attempt to remove Lisa Cook from the Fed board risks eroding trust in the central bank's autonomy, which undermines the dollar as a reserve currency and America's ability to service its debts. However, the most likely scenario for the September Fed policy meeting is a single 'hawkish cut' followed by a pause for the rest of the year, Ferguson wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations.
* 'STABLECOIN PARADOX': Digital currencies pegged to fiat money face built-in tensions between credibility and competition, creating a 'stablecoin paradox', argue Eduardo Levy Yeyati and Sebastian Katz in column for CEPR's VoxEU. Pointing out that currency boards and hard pegs repeatedly failed under such pressure in the past, the 'paradox' is no longer abstract - it's the reality of a digital currency arms race between the two largest economies. The winner will be the system that can best resist erosion of its monetary discipline. America's test is how strict reserves can survive market incentives for growth while China is testing whether centralization can survive competitive pressures for private innovation. Both face the same trade-off: ""stability requires discipline, but growth demands elasticity"".
* 'LAND SWAP' THAT WASN'T: Shortly after meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow on August 6, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff delivered major news to Donald Trump: The Russian president was prepared to offer significant territorial concessions to end his war in Ukraine. Witkoff's readout to the U.S. President prompted Trump to hail his emissary's ""great progress"" and announce a historic summit with Putin - indicating a land swap was on the table.

The move broadens the Trump administration's cancellation of the 'de minimis' exemption for packages from China and Hong Kong in May as part of an effort to halt shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. The de minimis exemption has been in place since 1938, starting at $5 for gift imports and was raised from $200 to $800 in 2015 to foster small business growth in e-commerce markets.

By Laurie Chen
August 31, 2025, 2:41 PM GMT+5:30

TIANJIN, China, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said New Delhi was committed to improving ties with China in a key meeting with President Xi Jinping on Sunday, as both leaders discussed the need to expand trade and investment ties against the backdrop of U.S. tariffs.

Modi is in China for the first time in seven years to attend a two-day meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, along with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders from Central, South and Southeast Asia and the Middle East, in a show of Global South solidarity.

The bilateral meeting took place five days after Washington imposed punishing 50% tariffs on Indian goods due to New Delhi's purchases of Russian oil. Analysts say Xi and Modi are looking to present a united front against Western pressure.

Modi said India and China pursued strategic autonomy, and their ties should not be seen through the lens of a third country, according to an Indian foreign ministry readout of the meeting.

Modi and Xi discussed the need to proceed from a ""political and strategic direction"" to expand bilateral trade and investment ties, and reduce India's trade deficit with China, the Indian foreign ministry said.

The leaders also discussed expanding common ground on bilateral, regional, and global issues, and challenges like terrorism and fair trade in multilateral platforms, the Indian statement said.

""We are committed to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities,"" Modi told Xi during the meeting on the sidelines of the summit, according to a video clip posted on the Indian leader's official X account.

BORDER ISSUE

Modi said an atmosphere of ""peace and stability"" has been created on their disputed Himalayan border, the site of a prolonged military standoff after deadly troop clashes in 2020, which froze most areas of cooperation between the nuclear-armed strategic rivals.

He added that an agreement had been reached between both nations regarding border management, without giving details. The neighbours share a 3,800 km (2,400 miles) border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s.

""We must ... not let the border issue define the overall China-India relationship,"" Chinese state media outlet Xinhua reported Xi as saying.

China-India ties could be ""stable and far-reaching"" if both sides focused on viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, Xi added.

Both leaders had a breakthrough meeting in Russia last year after reaching a border patrol agreement, setting off a tentative thaw in ties that has accelerated in recent weeks as New Delhi seeks to hedge against renewed tariff threats from Washington.

Direct flights between both nations, which have been suspended since 2020, are being resumed, Modi added, without providing a timeframe.

China had agreed to lift export curbs on rare earths, fertilisers and tunnel boring machines this month during a key visit to India by China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

China opposes Washington's steep tariffs on India and will ""firmly stand with India,"" Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong said this month.

For decades, Washington painstakingly cultivated ties with New Delhi in the hope that it would act as a regional counterweight to Beijing.

In recent months, China has allowed Indian pilgrims to visit Hindu and Buddhist sites in Tibet, and both countries have lifted reciprocal tourist visa restrictions.

""Both India and China are engaged in what is likely to be a lengthy and fraught process of defining a new equilibrium in the relationship,"" said Manoj Kewalramani, a Sino-Indian relations expert at the Takshashila Institution think tank in Bengaluru.

However, other long-term irritants remain in the relationship.

China is India's largest bilateral trade partner, but the long-running trade deficit - a persistent source of frustration for Indian officials - reached a record $99.2 billion this year.

Meanwhile, a planned Chinese mega-dam in Tibet has sparked fears of mass water diversion that could reduce water flows on the major Brahmaputra River by up to 85% in the dry season, according to Indian government estimates.

India also hosts the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader whom Beijing views as a dangerous separatist influence. India's arch-rival Pakistan also benefits from staunch Chinese economic, diplomatic and military support.

Russian drones also targeted Ukraine's northern Chernihiv region on Sunday morning, damaging energy infrastructure and leaving 30,000 households without electricity, including part of the city of Nizhyn, said the local governor, Viacheslav Chaus.

In recent weeks, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukrainian energy and gas infrastructure. Ukraine, in turn, has struck Russian oil refineries and pipelines.

There was no comment from Russia on the latest attacks. Russia has hit Ukraine's critical infrastructure continuously throughout the 42 months of the war that Moscow launched with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Ukraine's largest power producer DTEK said in a statement that four of its power facilities had come under attack overnight.

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday used his Mann ki Baat address to focus on the growing devastation caused by natural disasters, as heavy rains, flash floods, and cloudbursts continue to wreak havoc across several parts of India.

The flash flooding and landslide triggered by cloudbursts and torrential rain in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand over the past month has brought the spotlight on extreme weather events battering India's Himalayas this monsoon season, while other states like Assam, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh also are reeling under floods.

Researchers have warned of climate change compounding the risk by exposing retreating glaciers to collapse.

Calling for a spirit of solidarity, Modi said that ""the pain of the families who lost their loved ones is our shared pain"" as hundreds of people have been displaced, roads and bridges washed away, and dozens of lives lost in the latest wave of extreme weather events.

Modi stressed that central and state agencies were working in coordination but underlined the need for community participation in relief efforts. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) continues to conduct rescue operations in flood-hit regions, with thousands of personnel deployed. Officials have warned that swelling rivers and saturated soil could trigger further landslides in hilly states in the coming weeks.

The Prime Minister, in his 125th address, also touched on other themes, including the launch of Pratibha Setu, an initiative to connect Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) aspirants with private companies for jobs.

He also highlighted the recently hosted first-ever day-night cricket match in J&K's Pulwama under the ongoing Royal Premier League, drawing thousands of spectators. ""Earlier this was impossible, but now my country is transforming,"" said the PM.

He also mentioned India's first Khelo India Water Sports Festival held at Srinagar's Dal Lake between August 21-23, which saw participation of over 800 athletes, including women. ""Women athletes were also not far behind… their participation was also at par with men,"" he said.

Modi also interacted with Odisha's Rashmita Sahu, who won gold in both singles 200 metre and 500 metre doubles in canoeing, and gold medallist in 1000m kayaking Mohsin Ali.

The PM closed his Mann ki Baat address by greeting the nation on Ganesh Utsav and urging people to celebrate festivals the ""swadeshi"" way.

Meanwhile, after roads were swept away and access to villages was completely disrupted, a medical team assisted in the childbirth of a 21-year-old woman at her home in Baksir village of the Jakholi block in Rudraprayag late on Saturday night. The health department team remains in touch with the woman’s family to ensure no further complications arise, officials said.","Heavy rains in Uttarakhand caused floods that washed away bridges and highways, isolating multiple villages.

According to relatives, the victim, identified as Manju Prakash, a resident of Ranganatha Layout in Bannerghatta, had a numbness in his leg due to a previous accident, and hence could not have felt the pain of the snake bite.

The incident took place after Prakash, 41, who was employed at TCS, returned home from a sugarcane shop wearing his Crocs around 12.45 pm. He had gone to his room to take a rest, leaving the footwear outside.

On noticing a dead snake next to the Crocs Prakash had worn an hour ago, family members rushed to Prakash’s room, suspecting that the reptile could have been inside Prakash’s footwear.

They found him lying on the bed with foam in his mouth and his leg bleeding, and immediately shifted him to a private hospital where doctors declared him dead.

“On returning home, Prakash went to his room and slept. After nearly an hour, a labourer who visited our house noticed a snake just outside the Crocs. Upon checking, it was found that the snake was dead,” the victim’s brother said.

Prakash who had met with a bus accident in 2016, had undergone leg surgery. After the incident, he had lost sensation in his leg.

The snake has reportedly died of suffocation inside the Crocs, said a family member.","A Bengaluru software engineer died after being bitten by a snake hidden in his Crocs, a tragedy likely made worse as he had no sensation in his leg due to a previous injury.

43,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3mj0vkzro,"A recent court ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in the western Indian city of Mumbai has become a major flashpoint between civic bodies, public health activists and bird lovers. This month, hundreds of people clashed with police twice while protesting the closure of a decades-old pigeon feeding spot, or a kabutarkhana. Some tore down the tarpaulin sheets covering the spot and threatened an indefinite hunger strike. Police briefly detained about 15 people at another protest, media reports said. Authorities had imposed the ban due to concerns about health hazards due to pigeon droppings. The problem is not unique to Mumbai. In Venice, feeding pigeons in historic squares is banned. Singapore imposes hefty fines, and New York and London have regulated feeding zones. In India too, Pune and Thane cities in Maharashtra state - of which Mumbai is the capital - have imposed penalties on feeding pigeons. Delhi is mulling an advisory against feeding the birds in public spaces. The crackdown has angered animal lovers and religious feeders, as pigeons are long woven into India's cultural fabric. Films often use shots of grain-feeding pigeons to evoke cities like Mumbai and Delhi, where the birds are a familiar presence on balconies and air-conditioners. Some of Mumbai's kabutarkhanas are iconic heritage structures and are said to have originated as charitable spaces where communities could donate grain. There are religious sentiments involved as well. In Mumbai, the Jain community, which considers feeding pigeons a pious duty, has been vocal in their protests. Elsewhere too, many share a bond with pigeons - seen as symbols of peace and loyalty. In Delhi, Syed Ismat says he has been feeding the birds for 40 years and considers them his family. ""They are innocent. Perhaps the most innocent of all creatures. All they ask for is a little kindness,"" said Mr Ismat. But these sentiments are pitted against studies which show that prolonged exposure to pigeon droppings poses risks of pulmonary and respiratory illnesses. A boom in India's pigeon population in recent years has heightened this risk, prompting the restrictions. Delhi-based biodiversity expert Faiyaz Khudsar says easy availability of food has led to overpopulation of pigeons in many countries. In India, he said, the challenge is compounded by a decline in birds like the goraiya, commonly known as the house sparrow, which are increasingly being displaced by pigeons. ""With easy food and no predators, pigeons are breeding faster than ever. They are outcompeting other urban birds, creating an ecological loss,"" Mr Khudsar said. The 2023 State of India's Birds report says pigeon numbers have risen more than 150% since 2000 - the biggest jump among all birds - leaving homes and public spaces with droppings, as each bird can produce up to 15kg (33lbs) a year. Studies show these droppings contain at least seven types of zoonotic pathogens that can cause diseases such as pneumonia, fungal infections and even lung damage in humans. Nirmal Kohli, a 75-year-old Delhi resident, started complaining of persistent cough and had trouble breathing a few years ago. ""Eventually, a CT scan showed that part of her lung had shrunk,"" says her son Amit Kohli. ""The doctors said it was due to exposure to pigeon droppings."" Last year, an 11-year-old boy died in Delhi due to hypersensitivity pneumonitis - a disease that causes inflammation in lungs. Doctors said the reason was prolonged exposure to pigeon droppings and feathers. RS Pal, a pulmonologist, told the BBC that such cases were common. ""Even if you don't directly feed pigeons, their droppings on window sills and balconies can cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis,"" he said. ""We also see bacterial, viral and fungal infections in people handling pigeons regularly."" These concerns are what led the Mumbai civic body to impose the feeding ban last month and launch a drive to demolish feeding centres. Demolitions are on hold, but the Bombay High Court has dismissed a plea against the feeding ban, citing public health as ""paramount"" and ordering strict action on illegal feeding. Delhi mayor Raja Iqbal Singh told the BBC that love for birds cannot come at the cost of people's well-being. ""Feeding spots often turn dirty, leading to foul smells, infections and pests. We are working to minimise feeding,"" he said. But many animal lovers disagree. Mohammad Younus, who supplies grains to a feeding spot in Delhi, argues that all animals can spread diseases if hygiene is not maintained. ""I have been surrounded by pigeons for the past 15 years. If something were to happen, it would have happened to me too,"" he said. In Mumbai, a Jain monk told BBC Marathi that thousands of pigeons would die of hunger due to the feeding ban. Megha Uniyal, an animal rights activist, pointed out that there was no clarity on how the ban on feeding pigeons would be implemented. ""As far as regulating pigeon feeding is concerned, it is a word thrown around by the authorities, but no one really understands what this could entail,"" she said. Amid these competing contentions, efforts are on to find a middle ground. Ujjwal Agrain, of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) India, suggests allowing pigeon feeding only during set morning and evening hours. ""That gives enough time for civic bodies to clean the place and maintain hygiene. This way, we respect both public health and emotional bonds,"" he said. The Bombay High Court has set up an expert panel to suggest alternatives, and Mumbai civic officials say controlled, staggered feeding may be allowed based on its advice. For Syed Ismat, the solution lies in rethinking the relationship between birds and urban spaces. ""Maybe it's time to reimagine how we share our cities, not just with pigeons but with all forms of life,"" he said.","Mumbai authorities banned pigeon feeding in public spaces due to health risks from droppings, sparking protests from animal lovers and religious communities, particularly Jains who consider it pious duty. The ban follows rising pigeon populations and health concerns as droppings contain disease-causing pathogens. Authorities and activists are exploring middle-ground solutions like scheduled feeding with proper hygiene measures.",0,1,0,1,1

The rupee dropped to 12.3862 against the offshore yuan on Friday, extending its weekly decline to 1.2% and the monthly drop to 1.6%. Over the past four months, the Indian currency has tumbled nearly 6% against the yuan. The rupee's fall versus the yuan reflects the contrasting recent news flow about U.S. tariffs for India and China, according to Gaura Sen Gupta, economist at IDFC FIRST Bank. Washington imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods this week, doubling the total duties faced by the South Asian nation to 50%. Meanwhile Chinese goods face a lower 30% tariff from the U.S. with a pause on higher triple-digit duties remaining in place. The yuan-rupee forex rate matters for India's trade performance, considering that the two economies compete directly in key U.S-bound sectors such as textiles, engineering goods and chemicals. A weaker rupee against the yuan makes Indian products relatively cheaper than those of Chinese rivals in the export market, partially cushioning the blow from higher U.S. tariffs. Plus, a weaker rupee against the yuan could help narrow India's trade deficit with China. The yuan-rupee cross is among the key metrics tracked by the Reserve Bank of India, according to a person familiar with the central bank's thinking. They asked not to be identified since they were not authorized to speak to media. The central bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The RBI will likely welcome the rupee's drop against the yuan considering that it does not involve the currency weakening ""beyond their comfort"" versus the dollar, said Dhiraj Nim, FX strategist at ANZ Bank. ""The RBI should anyway be welcoming a weaker rupee per se... that it is relative to the yuan, all the better,"" he said. The rupee fell past the 88-per-dollar mark on Friday, hitting a record low of 88.29. Bankers said the Reserve Bank of India likely stepped in to support the currency.","The Indian rupee hit a record low against the offshore Chinese yuan, declining 1.2% weekly and 1.6% monthly due to contrasting U.S. tariff impacts on India and China.

India had been planning to send Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to Washington in the coming weeks for an announcement on some of the purchases, but that trip has been cancelled, two of the people said. Trump on Aug. 6 imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods as punishment for Delhi's purchases of Russian oil, which he said meant the country was funding Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That raised the total duty on Indian exports to 50% - among the highest of any U.S. trading partner. The president has a history of rapidly reversing himself on tariffs and India has said it remains actively engaged in discussions with Washington. One of the people said the defence purchases could go ahead once India had clarity on tariffs and the direction of bilateral ties, but ""just not as soon as they were expected to."" Written instructions had not been given to pause the purchases, another official said, indicating that Delhi had the option to quickly reverse course, though there was ""no forward movement at least for now."" Post publication of this story, India's government issued a statement it attributed to a Ministry of Defence source describing news reports of a pause in the talks as ""false and fabricated."" The statement also said procurement was progressing as per ""extant procedures."" Delhi, which has forged a close partnership with America in recent years, has said it is being unfairly targeted and that Washington and its European allies continue to trade with Moscow when it is in their interest. Reuters is reporting for the first time that discussions on India's purchases of Stryker combat vehicles made by General Dynamics Land Systems and Javelin anti-tank missiles developed by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have been paused due to the tariffs. Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in February announced plans to pursue procurement and joint production of those items. Singh had also been planning to announce the purchase of six Boeing P8I reconnaissance aircraft and support systems for the Indian Navy during his now-cancelled trip, two of the people said.

Last week, the AI giant made some tweaks to its pricing page, including a new subscription plan dubbed ChatGPT Go. It's worth noting that the new ChatGPT subscription tier's availability is limited to certain regions like India, and it will cost 399 INR (Indian Rupee), which roughly translates to $5 per month. The new subscription plan offers some sort of middle ground for users trying to get a little more out of what ChatGPT offers free, but not to the extent of a power user, who'd be better off getting the Plus or Pro plan. OpenAI's primary focus with ChatGPT Go is centered on affordability to promote broader adoption across the world. However, it ships with a handful of nifty features, including: Access to OpenAI's new flagship model GPT-5, Expanded messaging and uploads, Expanded image creation, Limited deep research, Longer memory and context, Extended advanced data analysis. OpenAI officially announced that it had launched ChatGPT Go in India earlier this week, with CEO Sam Altman expressing enthusiasm over what the future holds. ""Looking forward to making ChatGPT more affordable in India first, and then learning from feedback to expand to other countries,"" the executive added. But as it seems, multiple users aren't enthused by OpenAI's move to expand ChatGPT paid subscription plans to other regions. However, it's not the expanded reach that seems to perturb users. A user on X (formerly Twitter) indicated, ""Bro they just dropped the expansion pack for harvesting Indian memory cores at scale."" The users further claimed that ChatGPT Go wasn't a subscription plan but a ""soul funnel."" On the other hand, some users were happy about the launch of ChatGPT Go in India, further applauding OpenAI's quest to support different needs across the board. According to a user on X: ""You really thought people in India will subscribe to ChatGPT Go for 399 Rs/month when majority of the Indians don't even subscribe to Youtube Premium Family Plan of 299 Rs/month?? With all the AI and insights you have, someone thought this was workable? This is laughable."" However, this comment on Sam Altman's post on X received backlash, claiming that the user was misinformed and that the claim was baseless. Some even claimed that they had friends and students subscribed to even higher and more expensive subscription tiers like ChatGPT Plus. Some used the opportunity to pinpoint the flaw in OpenAI's marketing and launch of ChatGPT Go. ""You could have announced this on 15th August, ended with ""Jai Hind"" and sales would have gone 10x,"" the X user indicated. ""Sadly, you don't know how to launch in India."" Another point of view from users suggested that ChatGPT Go would equip bad actors and scammers with next-gen technology to deploy their deceptive tactics on unsuspecting users. ""This is a global nightmare, giving the least ethical people AI to scam the world better with,"" one user indicated. While this seems to be a hot topic across social media and has sparked a lot of interest and concern in equal measure, the new subscription plan's adoption and negative/positive implications for society remain to be seen.","OpenAI launched ChatGPT Go subscription tier in India at 399 INR ($5/month) to promote affordability and broader AI adoption, featuring GPT-5 access and enhanced capabilities.

He learned that his brother, Kairul, and four other relatives were among 40 Rohingya refugees allegedly deported by the Indian government to Myanmar, a country they had fled in fear years ago. Myanmar is in the midst of a brutal civil war between the junta - which seized power in a 2021 coup - and ethnic militias and resistance forces. The odds that Mr Amin will ever see his family again are vanishingly small. Three months after they were removed from India's capital, the BBC managed to contact the refugees in Myanmar. Most are staying with the Ba Htoo Army (BHA), a resistance group fighting the military in the south-west of the country. ""We don't feel secure in Myanmar. This place is a complete war zone,"" said Soyed Noor on a video call made from the phone of a BHA member. He spoke from a wooden shelter with six other refugees around him. We have learnt that they were flown from Delhi to an island in the Bay of Bengal, put on a naval vessel and eventually forced into the Andaman Sea with life jackets. They then made their way to shore and are now facing an uncertain future in Myanmar, which the mostly-Muslim Rohingya community had fled in huge numbers in recent years to escape persecution. ""They bound our hands, covered our faces and brought us like captives [on to the boat]. Then they threw us in the sea,"" John, one of the men in the group, told his brother by phone soon after reaching land. Thomas Andrews, the UN's special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, says there is ""significant evidence"" proving these allegations, which he has presented to India's head of mission in Geneva but has yet to receive a response. The BBC has also contacted India's Ministry of External Affairs several times but had not heard back by time of publication. Campaigners have often flagged that the condition of Rohingya in India is precarious. India does not recognise the Rohingya as refugees but rather, as illegal immigrants under the country's Foreigners Act. India has a sizeable population of Rohingya refugees, although Bangladesh, where more than a million live, has the biggest number. Most fled Myanmar after a deadly army crackdown in 2017. Despite having lived there for generations, Rohingya are not recognised in Myanmar as citizens. There are 23,800 Rohingya refugees in India registered with the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency. But Human Rights Watch estimates that the actual number is upwards of 40,000.","Forty Rohingya refugees were allegedly deported by India to Myanmar via naval vessel, forced to jump into the Andaman Sea with life jackets and swim to shore.

48,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2vr37yd4no,"Over the last three years, the Russian state-backed news channel RT and news agency and radio Sputnik, have expanded their international presence; between them, they now broadcast across Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Latin America. This all coincides with bans in Western countries. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, sweeping restrictions were imposed to RT's broadcasting in the US, UK, Canada and across the European Union – as well as by major tech companies – for spreading disinformation about the war. This culminated in 2024, when US authorities sanctioned RT executives - including its editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan - for alleged attempts to harm ""public trust"" in the country's institutions. Yet elsewhere, RT's influence has only expanded. Since 2023, RT has opened a bureau in Algeria, launched a TV service in Serbian, and started free training programmes aimed at journalists from Africa, Southeast Asia, India, and China. The broadcaster has also announced it will open an office in India. Sputnik, meanwhile, launched a newsroom in Ethiopia in February. All of this coincides with an apparent weakening from the Western media in some regions. Thanks to budget cuts and changing foreign policy priorities, certain outlets have downsized and even withdrawn from parts of the world. Two years ago, the BBC closed its Arabic radio service in favour of its digital-based service. That same year Russia's Sputnik started a 24-hour service in Lebanon, occupying the airwave vacated by BBC Arabic. Meanwhile, the US government-funded international broadcasting service Voice of America has cut most of its staff. ""Russia is like water: where there are cracks in the cement, it trickles in,"" says Dr Kathryn Stoner, political scientist at Stanford University. Russian propaganda, he argues, is also spread smartly: its content is calibrated to cater to specific audiences, even if it means adopting different ideological stances in different regions. Take the perception of RT. In the West it is often seen as a ""Russian state actor and propagator of disinformation,"" he says. In other parts of the world, however, it is often regarded as a legitimate broadcaster with its own editorial line. This makes viewers susceptible to believing it - ""not all crazy conspiracy theorists who naively fall for disinformation"". On the surface, RT's international site looks like a standard news website and it reports some stories accurately. ""[It's] a very careful manipulation"", argues Dr Precious Chatterje-Doody, senior lecturer in Politics and International Studies at The Open University. The broadcaster also makes explicit false claims, such as portraying Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 as a peaceful ""reunification"", denying clear evidence of military involvement. It has systematically denied evidence of Russian war crimes committed in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022.","Russian state-backed media RT and Sputnik have dramatically expanded their global presence over the past three years, filling gaps left by Western media budget cuts in Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Despite sanctions and bans in Western countries for spreading disinformation about Ukraine, RT has opened new bureaus, launched training programs for journalists, and tailored propaganda to specific regional audiences.

49,https://example.com/sudan-landslide-news,"A landslide has killed at least 1,000 people in the remote Marra Mountains in western Sudan, according to the rebel group The Sudan Liberation Movement/Army.

Days of heavy rain triggered the landslide on Sunday, which left just one survivor and 'levelled' much of the village of Tarasin, the group said in a statement.

The movement has appealed for humanitarian assistance from the United Nations and other regional and international organisations.

Many residents from North Darfur state had sought refuge in the Marra Mountains region after war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) forced them from their homes.

Civil war that broke out in April 2023 between the Sudanese army and the RSF has plunged the country into famine and has led to accusations of genocide in the western Darfur region.

Estimates for death toll from the civil war vary significantly, but a US official last year estimated up to 150,000 people had been killed since hostilities began in 2023. About 12 million have fled their homes.

Factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army, which controls the area where the landslide occurred, have pledged to fight alongside the Sudanese military against the RSF.

Many Darfuris believe the RSF and allied militias have waged a war aimed at transforming the ethnically mixed region into an Arab-ruled domain.","A devastating landslide in Sudan's Marra Mountains has claimed at least 1,000 lives, with only one survivor and much of the village of Tarasin destroyed. Triggered by heavy rains in a region already scarred by civil war, the disaster has worsened an ongoing humanitarian crisis as millions had already been displaced by conflict. Rebel groups have appealed for international aid, emphasizing how ethnic violence and famine have destabilized the region. The Sudan Liberation Army blames the paramilitary RSF and broader war for much of the suffering.

The quake leveled villages, triggered landslides, and left relief efforts severely hampered by bad weather and damaged infrastructure. With global funding for Afghanistan already drastically reduced following the Taliban's 2021 return to power, local officials and humanitarian organizations have warned the disaster will far exceed available humanitarian resources. While nations such as the UK, China, and India have pledged limited support, most Western countries have not yet committed substantial new relief funding. The Taliban government has made public appeals for international aid, citing acute humanitarian need as they struggle to respond to the scale of the crisis.

Bias: The article presents factual reporting with moderate political and institutional bias; there is an implicit critique of Western countries for aid cuts and contextualizes the Taliban's appeal for help within the broader predicament of Afghanistan under their governance. Multiple sources are cited for accuracy, but the framing emphasizes Western decisions and their impact.","A powerful earthquake has killed at least 800 people and injured thousands more in eastern Afghanistan, compounding humanitarian hardship already caused by years of war, poverty, and recent aid cuts. The Taliban appeal for international help has so far generated only limited foreign support, with United Nations and local authorities warning of a response gap.

One woman was killed in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and 30 people were injured - including children - according to local officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched nearly 540 drones and 45 missiles, urging tough new sanctions on Moscow. Following the attack, Russia's defence ministry said all ""targets of the strike have been achieved"" and ""designated objects have been hit"" - a claim that has not been independently verified. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The latest barrage comes amid ongoing international efforts to secure a peace deal between the two warring nations - and days after the Ukrainian capital Kyiv faced the second largest aerial attack of the war so far, with at least 25 killed. In the south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, top official Serhiy Lysak reported a number of strikes on infrastructure facilities and after a ""massive"" drone and missile overnight attack. In the regional capital Dnipro, a residential house was completely destroyed and a shopping centre was damaged, Lysak said. No casualties were reported in the overnight strikes, but Lysak later said four people were injured in a Russian drone attack on Saturday afternoon. It is the second successive night Dnipropetrovsk has been targeted. Earlier this week, Kyiv acknowledged that Russia's military had entered the region and was trying to establish a foothold. Railway infrastructure was damaged near the capital, Kyiv, but it was central and south-eastern Ukraine that bore the brunt of the latest strikes. Emergency services were seen putting out fires in Zaporizhzhia, while explosions were heard in the central eastern regions. Meanwhile, Ukraine's military said its drones hit oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran in Russia overnight. Both refineries have been targeted before. The Ukrainian military said there had been ""numerous"" explosions and fires recorded at the facility in Krasnodar, which Kyiv said produces three million tons of petroleum products per year. The military also reported a fire at the Syzran facility, which it said produced eight-and-a-half million tons of petroleum products annually. Russian authorities in Krasnodar acknowledged the drone strikes had hit its oil refinery. They said one of the process units was damaged and a fire occurred in the area, adding that there had been no casualties. The Russian defence ministry said it had shot down 20 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 18 over the Crimean Peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Moscow annexed in 2014. The Russian military also said it captured Komyshevakha, a rural settlement in the eastern Donetsk region, on Saturday morning. Ukraine has not confirmed this. In recent months, Russian troops have continued their slow advance in eastern Ukraine, despite heavy combat casualties being reported. The chief of Russia's general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said on Saturday that his forces were continuing ""their non-stop offensive along almost the entire line of contact"". Friday night's aerial exchange follows US-led diplomatic efforts aimed at ending the war, which so far remain at a standstill. Zelensky said the latest attacks showed Russia's ""disregard for words"", adding that the only way to deal with Russia was to impose sanctions. ""We expect action from the US, Europe and the entire world,"" he said. European foreign affairs ministers are in Denmark this weekend to discuss international developments - including the war in Ukraine. One of the key issues on the table is the possibility of freezing approximately €210bn (£182bn; $245bn) worth of Russian assets. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, who is at the gathering, said it was clear ""Russia does not want peace"" despite diplomatic efforts. France would use the gathering to table new proposals for sanctions against Russia, with the aim of depleting ""the resources that Russia is investing in this war"" - Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot was quoted by Russia's state-owned news agency Tass as saying.Test article content to verify form functionality","Russia conducted a large-scale overnight assault on 14 Ukrainian regions, killing one and injuring thirty, mostly in Zaporizhzhia.

“I thought it was very very impressive, but I understood the reason they were doing it. And they were hoping I was watching — and I was watching,” Trump said, describing the spectacle as strategic military showboating.

The parade marked the 80th anniversary of Japan’s defeat in World War II, featuring displays of advanced weaponry and leaders from US adversaries including North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko.
Trump: “Not my place” to attend

Asked whether he had been invited, Trump dismissed the possibility of attending. “It wouldn’t have been my place,” the president said.

Earlier, he complained that Xi had failed to mention America’s role in Japan’s surrender during his speech.

“President Xi is a friend of mine, but I thought that the United States should have been mentioned last night during that speech, because we helped China very much,” Trump said.
Kremlin rejects Trump’s conspiracy claim

The Kremlin rejected Trump’s charge that Xi, Putin, and Kim were plotting against Washington.

“I would like to say that no one has been conspiring, no one has been plotting anything, no conspiracies,” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told Russian state television. “No one even had such a thought – none of these three leaders had such a thought.”

He added: “I can say that everyone understands the role played by the United States, the current administration of President Trump, and President Trump personally in the current international situation.”
Trump mixes pleasantries with accusations

Despite his criticism, Trump combined warm wishes with suspicion in a post on Truth Social.

“May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.”
Xi warns of “peace or war” choice

In his speech at the parade, Xi cautioned the world was at a crossroads. “The world is facing a choice between peace or war,” he warned, as the event culminated in the release of 80,000 doves over Beijing.

Xi also held bilateral talks with Putin, calling him his “old friend,” and earlier met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump is quoted responding to the event by describing it as ""very impressive,"" while also interpreting it as a strategic demonstration intended for American observation. Trump suggests that leaders like Xi and Putin were ""hoping I was watching,"" referring to the parade as an instance of military showmanship aimed at making a statement to Washington.

When asked about potential attendance, Trump dismisses the notion by stating it ""wouldn’t have been my place"" to attend but expresses disappointment that Xi did not acknowledge America’s contribution to Japan’s surrender in his speech. Trump emphasizes that the United States played a vital role in aiding China during World War II and that this role should have been recognized during the commemoration.

In contrast, the Kremlin, through aide Yuri Ushakov, firmly rejects Trump’s implication of a conspiracy or coordinated plotting among Russia, China, and North Korea against the United States. Ushakov asserts there were no discussions or thoughts of conspiracy among the leaders, reiterating a respect for America's role in global affairs and the current international landscape.

Despite flirting with accusations, Trump tempers his statements with pleasantries in his post on Truth Social, offering warm wishes to President Xi and the people of China alongside tongue-in-cheek remarks about alleged scheming against the U.S. The article also notes that Xi Jinping, in his speech, frames the current global situation as a crucial choice between ""peace or war,"" reflecting the seriousness of ongoing international tensions.

Xi also has bilateral meetings with Vladimir Putin, whom he refers to as his ""old friend,"" and meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, underscoring the diplomatic significance of the gathering.

Addressing fears of a new alliance or ""axis"" forming against Washington, Trump downplays any concern, emphasizing his confidence in the overwhelming strength of the U.S. military and bluntly stating, ""They would never use their military on us. Believe me.""

Xi also held bilateral talks with Putin, calling him his “old friend,” and earlier met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Trump downplays fears of “axis”

Asked if he feared an “axis” forming against Washington, Trump brushed aside concerns. “I am not concerned at all … We have the strongest military in the world, by far. They would never use their military on us. Believe me,” he said.","The article details a significant international event—a massive military parade held in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of Japan’s defeat in World War II. The parade saw high-profile attendance from world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, and Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko, signaling a display of unity among countries often seen as geopolitical rivals to the United States.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump is quoted responding to the event by describing it as ""very impressive,"" while also interpreting it as a strategic demonstration intended for American observation. Trump suggests that leaders like Xi and Putin were ""hoping I was watching,"" referring to the parade as an instance of military showmanship aimed at making a statement to Washington.

When asked about potential attendance, Trump dismisses the notion by stating it ""wouldn’t have been my place"" to attend but expresses disappointment that Xi did not acknowledge America’s contribution to Japan’s surrender in his speech. Trump emphasizes that the United States played a vital role in aiding China during World War II and that this role should have been recognized during the commemoration.

In contrast, the Kremlin, through aide Yuri Ushakov, firmly rejects Trump’s implication of a conspiracy or coordinated plotting among Russia, China, and North Korea against the United States. Ushakov asserts there were no discussions or thoughts of conspiracy among the leaders, reiterating a respect for America's role in global affairs and the current international landscape.

Despite flirting with accusations, Trump tempers his statements with pleasantries in his post on Truth Social, offering warm wishes to President Xi and the people of China alongside tongue-in-cheek remarks about alleged scheming against the U.S. The article also notes that Xi Jinping, in his speech, frames the current global situation as a crucial choice between ""peace or war,"" reflecting the seriousness of ongoing international tensions. The parade itself is characterized by impressive displays of military equipment and the symbolic release of 80,000 doves over Beijing.

Xi also has bilateral meetings with Vladimir Putin, whom he refers to as his ""old friend,"" and meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, underscoring the diplomatic significance of the gathering.

Addressing fears of a new alliance or ""axis"" forming against Washington, Trump downplays any concern, emphasizing his confidence in the overwhelming strength of the U.S. military and bluntly stating, ""They would never use their military on us. Believe me.""

Overall, the article weaves together diplomatic spectacle, political drama, and personal commentary, presenting intertwined narratives of rivalry, reassurance, and global diplomacy amid a climate of suspicion and strategic signaling.",1,0,0,1,0

A Simple Counselling Request

In one of the episodes of Figuring Out with Raj Shamani, private investigator Baldev Puri shared what he calls the “dirtiest and weirdest"" case of his career. Needless to say, it has the whole Internet stunned. Known for his ability to crack even the toughest cases, Puri’s shocking story had everything about family betrayal, secrets, wealth, and a twist no one saw coming.

It all began when the content creator Raj Shamani began the conversation by asking Puri about the weirdest case he has ever solved. Without wasting time, the investigator recalled a case that started as a simple counselling request but quickly turned into a full-blown investigation.

Puri, in the conversation, shared: “A father came to me with his elder son, saying they wanted to get their younger son investigated. He wasn’t getting married, and they thought maybe counselling would help.""

After Puri met the man, he noticed something odd and suggested surveillance for a week. What seemed like a small family concern soon became one of the most shocking cases of Puri’s career.

The Twist No One Saw Coming

Over the next few days, Puri’s team followed the younger son. Later, they uncovered a shocking pattern that the person was meeting a woman regularly and taking her to a hotel multiple times a week. The investigator captured the woman and presented her photo as evidence to the family. Quickly, the atmosphere in the room changed completely.

“The father looked at me and said, ‘She is my elder son’s wife. She’s my daughter-in-law.’ I was shocked. This wasn’t just an affair; this was a full-blown family conspiracy,"" Puri revealed on the podcast.

The discovery was darker than he expected. The family had known about the affair but the father wanted proof before confronting the truth.

Money, Power And Property

As Puri dug deep into the matter, he uncovered the truth. The affair did not stem from love but was purely about obsession with money, power, and property. The elder son and his wife allegedly orchestrated the entire affair to ensure their wealth stayed in their hands. The investigator even raised questions about the paternity of the children.

“Money had become so important that they were okay with this arrangement. They didn’t want the younger brother to marry someone else because then wealth would have to be shared. It was one of the dirtiest cases I’ve ever solved,"" Puri said, leaving Raj Shamani stunned.

The case involving betrayal and manipulation shocked even the investigator.

On the September 3, 2025, episode of “Figuring Out with Raj Shamani,” private investigator Baldev Puri shared what he called the “dirtiest and weirdest” case of his career, causing widespread astonishment on the Internet. Puri, known for solving challenging cases, recounted a story brimming with family betrayal, hidden motives, wealth, and an unforeseen twist.

The case began as a seemingly innocent request: a father and his elder son approached Puri because their younger son was refusing to get married, and they hoped counseling might help. Sensing something strange, Puri suggested a week’s surveillance. His team soon discovered that the younger son was meeting a woman at a hotel several times a week.

When Puri presented photographic evidence to the family, the atmosphere changed dramatically—the woman was identified as the elder son’s wife and the father's daughter-in-law. What initially appeared to be an affair revealed itself as a complex family conspiracy. According to Puri, the father suspected something but needed definitive proof before taking action.

Further investigation uncovered that the affair had little to do with romance. Instead, the driving force was an obsession with money, power, and property. The elder son and his wife coordinated the liaison to keep family wealth consolidated within their hands. By ensuring the younger son stayed unmarried, they could prevent division of property and guarantee inheritance remained in their line. Puri even questioned the paternity of any children born from the arrangement.

Puri stated, “Money had become so important that they were okay with this arrangement. They didn’t want the younger brother to marry someone else because then wealth would have to be shared. It was one of the dirtiest cases I’ve ever solved.” Raj Shamani, the host, was left stunned by the revelations. The story, laden with betrayal and manipulation for greed, shocked even the seasoned investigator.

In a sweeping overhaul under the new “GST 2.0,” sin and luxury goods will now attract a punishing 40% tax rate, up from the earlier 28%. Meanwhile, the rest of the economy shifts to a simpler two-slab structure, 5% and 18%, but the Council has slapped a whopping 40% tax on products deemed harmful or ultra-luxurious.
The changes kick in by September 22, 2025, and were cleared in the Council’s September 3 meeting. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had teased the move during his Independence Day speech, calling it a “Diwali gift” for citizens.
GST Council Meeting Live Updates
What Gets Costlier? Welcome to the 40% Club
Here’s the hit list of goods moving into the top tax bracket:

    Tobacco products: Gutkha, cigarettes, bidi, pan masala, zarda, scented and unmanufactured tobacco
    Sugary & fizzy drinks: Colas, flavoured sodas, caffeinated and energy drinks
    Luxury wheels: High-end cars and SUVs (specifics to be notified)
    Junk foods: Processed items high in sugar, salt, or trans fats
    Miscellaneous imports: Select personal-use dutiable goods (to be detailed in notifications)
    Alcohol, as always, stays outside GST and continues to be taxed by states.

Why the Crackdown?
“Sin taxes” are designed to make harmful goods pricier while boosting government revenue. India spends over 1% of its GDP dealing with cigarette-related health costs alone, giving the Centre all the more reason to target such products.
Cigarettes, for instance, already attract 28% GST plus a steep cess — a mix of specific duties (Rs 2.1 to Rs 4.2 per stick, depending on size) and an ad valorem cess (5%–36%). While the headline slab is being hiked, the effective tax burden on tobacco stays at 88%, according to reports.","Complete Summary (Preserving Perspective and All Details)
The GST Council has announced a major overhaul of India’s tax structure under the new “GST 2.0” regime. In a shift that will have widespread economic impact, the Council has increased the tax rate for sin and luxury goods from the previous 28% to a substantial 40%. This move is branded as a tax bomb on goods deemed particularly harmful or ultra-luxurious, while the broader economy transitions to a more straightforward two-slab structure: 5% and 18%.

These changes were ratified during the GST Council meeting held on September 3, 2025, and are set to come into effect on September 22, 2025. Prime Minister Narendra Modi referenced this major reform during his Independence Day speech, calling it a “Diwali gift” for the nation.

Products Facing 40% Tax (“40% Club”):

Tobacco products: gutkha, cigarettes, bidi, pan masala, zarda, and both scented and unmanufactured tobacco.

Sugary and fizzy drinks: colas, flavoured sodas, caffeinated and energy drinks.

Luxury vehicles: high-end cars and SUVs (specific models to be notified).

Junk foods: processed items high in sugar, salt, or trans fats.

Miscellaneous imports: select dutiable personal-use goods (details to be specified in formal notifications).

Alcohol remains excluded from GST and continues to be taxed by individual states.

The reasoning behind the steep tax is rooted in public health and revenue concerns. The so-called “sin taxes” are aimed at discouraging consumption of goods that cause harm to health, such as tobacco and sugary beverages, while also boosting government revenues. India reportedly spends over 1% of its GDP on health costs linked to cigarette use alone, providing additional justification for the hike.

Currently, cigarettes attract GST at 28% alongside a high cess, which is a combination of specific duties (ranging from ₹2.1 to ₹4.2 per cigarette stick based on size) and an ad valorem cess (from 5% to 36%). Despite the official GST slab being raised, the effective total tax burden on tobacco products, according to the latest reports, remains at approximately 88%.",1,1,0,1,0

Kushagra Dixit / TNN / Updated: Sep 04, 2025, 11:10 IST

Heavy discharge from Hathnikund barrage caused the Yamuna River to swell, crossing the 207-meter mark in Delhi and displacing around 12,000 people. The water level is expected to rise further, approaching the historic 1978 flood levels.

As heavy discharge from Hathnikund barrage continued to push water levels up, Yamuna crossed the 207-metre mark in Delhi at 1pm Wednesday. By 10pm, it had swelled to 207.43m—the third highest level reached since systematic record-keeping began in 1963—inundating numerous villages and areas such as Ring Road, parts of Civil Lines, Bela Road, and Sonia Vihar, among others, and displacing around 12,000 people.

Delhi Flood Alert:
Yamuna Breaches Rare Levels in Delhi, Loha Pul Closed Amid Flood Fears

The Central Water Commission expects Yamuna to rise further and touch 207.48m by 8am Thursday, very close to the mark of the historic Delhi floods of September 1978.

Flood waters reached Ring Road and Outer Ring Road, impacting traffic between Majnu ka Tilla and Salimgarh bypass. MCD stopped cremations at Nigambodh Ghat and the Geeta Colony ground due to flooding.

River water also entered Vishwakarma Colony in Jaitpur and Civil Lines' Monastery market, while a simultaneous rescue operation continued at southwest Delhi's Geetanjali Enclave in Jharoda Kalan. A breach in Mungeshpur drain, a subsidiary of Najafgarh drain, flooded the area with neck-deep water late Tuesday night.

How discharge from Hathnikund barrage has spelt trouble for Delhi:
District magistrate (East) Amol Srivastava, the nodal officer for the flood situation, said NDRF teams were deployed based on requests made by the southeast, central, and east Delhi districts. “Between 10,000 to 12,000 people have been rescued so far, with the number of people in tents fluctuating as some leave to stay with their relatives. Relief camps have been set up at 38 locations. While over 2,000 people are in permanent shelters, the remaining are in tents,” said the official.

On Wednesday, Hathnikund barrage in Haryana released about 1.6 lakh cusecs of water at 3 pm, up from 1.1 lakh cusecs late Tuesday night, following intense rainfall in the upper Yamuna catchment in the Himalayas. The discharge rose to 1.78 lakh cusecs by 7pm, Wednesday. The usual discharge at Hathnikund barrage is less than 50,000 cusecs.

The India Meteorological Department has forecast some relief, with rain intensity in Uttarakhand likely to decrease from Thursday onwards, potentially easing the flow upstream. “Today (Wednesday) is the last day of extreme weather conditions in Uttarakhand as by Thursday onwards we expect a gradual return to normalcy. Significant respite from ongoing extreme rainfall conditions is expected over the Himalayan region and adjoining plains of Haryana, Punjab, Delhi and UP. But over eastern Rajasthan, rainfall will continue over the next three days,” said IMD senior scientist Krishna Kumar Mishra.

In July 2023, when Delhi saw its worst floods, the discharge from Hathnikund had remained well above 1 lakh cusecs for five days, while the peak discharge was observed at 3.59 lakh cusecs on July 11. The city was flooded by July 13, 2023, with water reaching Red Fort.

Officials at the irrigation and flood control department, Delhi, however, said that they are better prepared this time, with all ITO barrage gates open and important regulators closed. In 2023, while a regulator at ITO broke, five ITO barrage gates were also jammed, impacting the flow of the river.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on Wednesday approved a complete overhaul of India's tax consumption tax since its launch in 2017, slashing duties on household essentials, medicines, small cars and appliances and affecting everything from toothpaste and insurance to tractors and cement.

Earlier, at 8 am, the level at the ORB was 206.83 metres, already above the 206-metre evacuation mark that had been crossed on Tuesday. By 8 pm, on Wednesday, the level had risen further to 207.39 metres.

District administrations reported that more than 7,500 residents from the East, North, Southeast, Northeast, and Central districts had been moved to safety.

“Across five districts, more than 7,500 people have been evacuated. They have been shifted to relief camps at 25 locations, including tents, schools, etc.,” an official said. With water lapping at approach roads, the ORB remained closed to traffic throughout the day.

Officials attributed the steady rise to heavy discharges upstream. The Central Flood Control Room (CFCR) said the river received a discharge of 1.62 lakh cusecs from the Hathnikund Barrage and 1.38 lakh cusecs from the Wazirabad Barrage at 8 am.

“The rising water level is mostly due to the high volumes of water being released from the Wazirabad and Hathnikund barrages every hour. The forecast indicates a further increase in the water level,” a CFCR official said. The government added that it is monitoring flows round-the-clock from the Hathnikund, Wazirabad, and Okhla barrages.

During an inspection at the ITO barrage, Delhi Irrigation and Flood Control Minister Parvesh Verma urged calm, noting that recent desilting and channel-improvement work had expanded the river’s carrying capacity.

“In the past six months, steps have been taken by various departments to increase the river’s carrying capacity. Currently, the situation is under control, and even if the level rises by one or two metres more, water will not enter Delhi roads like it did in 2023,” he told reporters.

He added that “the Yamuna has not entered any authorised households,” and that rescue teams were operating in the floodplain. “Even if the level touches 209 metres, no authorised area will be flooded. We are expecting the water level to start reducing by evening,” he said.

The surge disrupted cremations at Nigambodh Ghat, the city’s oldest and busiest cremation ground, located along Ring Road behind the Red Fort.

With 42 platforms and an average daily load of 55–60 cremations, the facility halted new funerals on Wednesday afternoon after floodwaters entered the premises.

“Until about two hours ago, only rainwater had entered the premises. A wall approximately seven to eight feet high was damaged at the top, with about two feet collapsing, allowing Yamuna water to enter,” a management official at the ghat said. He noted that the ghat operated until 2:30 pm, after which no fresh cremations were taken up. Families arriving later were redirected to other cremation grounds.

The MCD said that rituals which had begun earlier in the morning were being completed.

Authorities appealed to residents in low-lying areas to heed evacuation advisories and make use of the facilities at the 25 relief sites. With inflows still elevated and the ORB closed, agencies said they would maintain heightened vigilance as the city awaited signs of the river receding.","The report details the worsening flood situation in New Delhi as the Yamuna River continued to rise on Wednesday, crossing 207 metres at the Old Railway Bridge (ORB) by 1 pm. This prompted new evacuations from low-lying areas. The river, which was already above the evacuation mark early in the morning (206.83 metres at 8 am), reached 207.39 metres by 8 pm.

More than 7,500 people across East, North, Southeast, Northeast, and Central Delhi districts were relocated to safety, accommodated in relief camps at 25 different sites, including tents and schools. The ORB, with water threatening the roads, remained closed to traffic throughout the day.

The steady increase in the Yamuna’s water level was attributed to heavy upstream discharges: 1.62 lakh cusecs from the Hathnikund Barrage and 1.38 lakh cusecs from the Wazirabad Barrage at 8 am, according to the Central Flood Control Room (CFCR). The situation was expected to get worse before improvement, with government agencies monitoring barrage inflows around the clock.

Delhi’s Irrigation and Flood Control Minister Parvesh Verma inspected the ITO barrage, assuring the public that recent desilting and river channel improvements had increased the Yamuna’s capacity. He stated the situation was ""under control,"" asserting that even if waters rose one or two metres more, roads would not flood like in 2023. No authorized residential areas had been affected so far, and rescue operations were ongoing in the floodplain. Verma predicted water levels would soon start receding and maintained that even at 209 metres, authorized regions would not be flooded.

The floods disrupted operations at Nigambodh Ghat, Delhi’s largest and busiest cremation ground, which was forced to halt new cremations after Yamuna waters entered the premises by breaking through a damaged section of a boundary wall. Cremations already underway in the morning were allowed to finish, but families arriving later were sent to other facilities.

Authorities continued to urge residents of vulnerable areas to follow evacuation orders and use the relief camps, while maintaining a high state of readiness in anticipation of further developments as the city waited for signs that the river would recede.",0,0,0,1,0

The Times of India

BENGALURU: Two separate cases of suicide by women allegedly due to dowry harassment have rocked Bengaluru this week.

Case 1: Poojashree
A 28-year-old woman named Poojashree, who was the mother of a 10-month-old child, died by suicide at her home in Bagalagunte on Tuesday. Police said she was subjected to repeated dowry demands and harassment by her husband, Nandish, and his mother. According to the complaint given by her mother, Poojashree was harassed both mentally and physically. She was also upset over Nandish's alleged extramarital affair.
Despite several attempts by her family to intervene, the abuse continued. The Bagalagunte police have registered a case against Nandish, his mother, and three others, arresting all under charges of dowry harassment and abetment of suicide.

Case 2: Shilpa
Earlier this week, a 27-year-old pregnant techie named P Shilpa was found dead at her BTM Layout residence. She was five months pregnant and was found hanging in her home. Police sources said there was no suicide note. She is survived by her elderly parents, two sisters, and a son.
Her mother, B Sharada, filed a complaint alleging that her husband Praveen and mother-in-law Shantavva harassed Shilpa for dowry and were responsible for her death. According to police, Praveen used to work as a software engineer but had recently been selling pani-puris after losing his job last year.
Police have detained both accused. Further investigation is ongoing.

Both cases highlight the continued prevalence of dowry-related violence and the urgent need for enforcement of anti-dowry laws. Despite strict legislation, incidents of dowry harassment and violence against women continue to be reported across the country.","Complete Summary
The article details two recent tragedies in Bengaluru related to dowry harassment and the resulting suicides of two women. The first case involves 28-year-old Poojashree, a mother of a 10-month-old, who died by suicide at her Bagalagunte home allegedly due to repeated dowry harassment and her husband's extramarital affair. According to her mother’s complaint, Poojashree faced both mental and physical abuse from her husband, Nandish, and her mother-in-law, especially after questioning Nandish's infidelity. Family efforts to intervene were unsuccessful. The police have arrested Nandish, his mother, and three others on charges of dowry harassment and abetment to suicide.

The second case, earlier in the same week, concerned a 27-year-old pregnant software engineer named P Shilpa, found hanging in her BTM Layout I Stage residence. There was no suicide note. Shilpa is survived by her parents, two sisters, and her son. Her mother, B Sharada, filed a complaint accusing Shilpa’s husband, Praveen, and his mother, Shantavva, of dowry harassment and contributing to her suicide. Police detained both accused.

The existing slabs of 28% and 12% will be done away with. This confirms multiple CNBC-TV18 newsbreaks with regards to the GST rate rationalisation, which were reported since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Independence Day address on August 15.
These revised rates of GST will take effect from September 22.

Brokerage firm Nomura wrote in a note that the council bringing down GST for a number of staples and essential categories from 18% to 5%, is a meaningful reduction and will bring relief to stressed consumption, aid volume growth, and drive formalisation, as quite a few categories in India have a notable share from unorganised players.

Here are some of the key FMCG stocks that are likely to benefit from this GST rate rationalisation:


Colgate

100% of the company's portfolio benefits as toothpaste, toothbrush and personal wash go from 18% to 5%, while toothpowder goes from 12% to 5%.
Britannia

Nearly 85% of its portfolio will benefit as biscuits and cakes, which account for 78% of its overall sales, go from 18% to 5%, while Dairy, which is 5% of Britannia's overall sales, also moves to 5%.
Nestle India
As much as 67% of the overall sales of the company will benefit, as coffee and chocolates, which is nearly a third of its overall sales, drop to 5% from 18%, while noodles, milkmaid, also drop to 5%. Noodles and Milkmaid form 35% of the overall sales.
Dabur

Nearly half of its consolidated sales will benefit from this move as 28% sales for the company comes from toothpastes and hair oils and shampoos, moves to 5% from 18%. Along with this, 25% of its overall sales, which come from juices, digestives, ethical and toothpowder also moves from 12% to 5%.
Hindustan Unilever
37% of HUL's overall sales, which comes from saps, shampoos, toothpastes, health food drinks and coffee goes from 18% to 5%, while sauces, jams, mayonnaise, noodles, which account for nearly 3% of the overall sales, move from 12% to a 5% GST rate.
Bikaji Foods

Nearly 80% to 85% of the company's revenue comes from namkeens, bhujia and snack, where the GST rate goes down to 5% from 12%.
Bajaj Consumers

The GST on Hair Oil will also come down to 5% from 18% earlier, and nearly 83% of the company's overall sales come from hair oils.
Varun Beverages

Carbonated Beverages will now be taxed at a rate of 40% from 28% earlier. However, the earlier rate had a 12% compensation cess, which will now be done away with and merged into the overall rate structure. Therefore, Nomura does not see any significant impact for such companies.
Footwear Stocks

Stocks like Bata, Red Tape, Metro Brands and others could be beneficiaries as the GST goes down to 5% from 12% earlier on footwear up to ₹2,500, while those costing ₹2,500 and above will continue to have a 18% GST.","Complete Summary
The GST Council has approved a major structural change to India’s GST rate system, introducing two main slabs—5% and 18%—and a special 40% rate for Sin and Luxury goods. The previous slabs of 12% and 28% will be eliminated. This reform, aligning with predictions since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Independence Day speech, will take effect on September 22.

Financial analysts, including brokerage firm Nomura, view the reduction of GST on essentials and staple goods from 18% to 5% as significant. This change is expected to offer relief for stressed consumption, support volume growth, and drive formalisation within the Indian market, as many fields have a considerable unorganised sector presence.

The article highlights key FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) and related companies that stand to benefit:

Colgate: The entire company portfolio, including toothpaste, toothbrushes, and personal wash, now falls from 18% to 5%; toothpowder drops from 12% to 5%.

Britannia: 85% of sales (biscuits and cakes, which make up 78% of sales, and dairy, 5%) shift from 18% to 5%.

Nestle India: 67% of sales (coffee, chocolates, noodles, and Milkmaid) drop from 18% to 5%; noodles and Milkmaid alone account for 35% of sales.

Dabur: Half of all sales benefit—28% from oral care and personal care products, and 25% from juices, digestives, and ethical products—all see taxes cut to 5%.

Hindustan Unilever: 37% of sales (soaps, shampoos, toothpastes, health drinks, coffee) fall to 5%, while products like sauces, jams, mayonnaise, and noodles (3% of sales) drop from 12% to 5%.

Bikaji Foods: 80–85% of revenue (namkeens, bhujia, snacks) will now be at 5% instead of 12%.

Bajaj Consumers: Hair oil drops to 5% from 18%, representing about 83% of overall sales.

Varun Beverages: Carbonated beverages will now have a 40% tax rate instead of 28% plus a 12% cess; analysts expect no major impact, as the effective rate remains similar.

Footwear brands (Bata, Red Tape, Metro Brands, etc.): GST on footwear below ₹2,500 drops to 5% from 12%, with pricier footwear taxed at 18%.

With the GST Council approving a complete overhaul of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, the Congress on Thursday (September 4, 2025) termed it a ""GST 1.5"" and said time alone will tell whether it would stimulate private investment as well as ease the burden on MSMEs.

GST Council meeting LIVE

The Opposition party asserted that the wait for a ""true GST 2.0"" continues.

Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said that for almost a decade, the party has been demanding simplification of GST.

“The Modi government changed ‘One Nation, One Tax’ to ‘One Nation, 9 Taxes’. It included tax slabs of 0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, 28% and special rates of 0.25%, 1.5%, 3% and 6%,” Mr. Kharge said.

“The Congress party had demanded GST 2.0 with a simple and rational tax system in its 2019 and 2024 manifestos. We had also demanded simplification of the complex compliances of GST, which had badly affected MSMEs and small businesses,” he said.

Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said that a key demand of the states made in the true spirit of cooperative federalism, namely the extension of compensation for another five years to fully protect their revenues, remains unaddressed.
 In fact, that demand assumes even greater importance now, he said.

The Indian National Congress has for long been advocating for a GST 2.0 that reduces the number of rates, cuts the rates on a large number of items of mass consumption, minimises evasion, mis-classification, and disputes, does away with inverted duty structure ' lower tax on output as compared to inputs ' eases the compliance burden on MSMEs, and expands GST coverage, Mr. Ramesh said on X.

He noted that Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has made major announcements last evening after the meeting of the GST Council, which is a constitutional body.

""However, even before the GST Council meeting, the Prime Minister had already proclaimed the substance of its decisions in his Independence Day speech of August 15th, 2025. Is the GST Council to be reduced to a formality?"" Mr. Ramesh said.

""Faced with a lack of buoyancy in private consumption, subdued rates of private investment, and endless classification disputes, the Union Finance Minister has finally recognised that GST 1.0 had reached a dead end. In fact, the very design of GST 1.0 was flawed and this had been pointed out by the INC way back in July 2017 itself, when the PM had made one of his typical U turns and decided to introduce GST,"" he said.

It was meant to be a Good and Simple Tax. It turned out to be a Growth Supressing Tax, Ramesh said.

Last evening's announcements have certainly made headlines since the Prime Minister had already laid down the pre-Diwali deadlines, he said.

Presumably the benefits of rate cuts will be passed on to consumers, he added.

""However, the wait for a true GST 2.0 continues. Whether this new GST 1.5, if it can be called that, stimulates private investment - especially in manufacturing - remains to be seen. Whether this will ease the burden on MSMEs, time alone will tell,"" Mr. Ramesh said.

Common use items from roti/paratha to hair oil, ice creams and TVs will cost less, while tax incidence on personal health and life insurance will be brought down to nil after the all-powerful GST Council on Wednesday approved a complete overhaul of the tangled Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.

The GST Council approved limiting slabs to 5% and 18%, effective from September 22, the first day of Navaratri.

Almost all personal-use items and aspirational goods for the middle class, like AC, washing machines, will see rate cuts as the government looks to boost domestic spending and cushion the economic blow of the U.S. tariffs.

Premium paid for individual life insurance and health insurance (including family floater), policies too have been exempted from GST.

Earlier, such policies were subject to 18% GST.

Briefing reporters after a marathon day-long GST Council meeting, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday (September 3, 2025) said all decisions were taken unanimously, with no disagreement with any state.

The panel approved simplifying the GST from the current four slabs - 5, 12, 18 and 28%, to a two-rate structure - 5 and 18%. A special 40% slab is also proposed for a select few items such as high-end cars, tobacco and cigarettes.

The new rates for all products, except pan masala, gutkha, cigarettes, chewing tobacco products like zarda, unmanufactured tobacco and bidi, will be effective September 22, she said. ","Complete Summary
The article covers reactions to the GST Council’s recent overhaul of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime in India, moving to a simplified two-slab structure (5% and 18%) with a special 40% rate for Sin and Luxury goods, phasing out the previous 12% and 28% slabs. The changes will take effect from September 22. While the government touts these reforms as landmark, the opposition Congress party criticizes them, labeling the move as merely a ""GST 1.5"" (not a full “GST 2.0”) and expressing skepticism about its potential to stimulate private investment and reduce the burden on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).

Congress leaders, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge and general secretary Jairam Ramesh, reference nearly a decade of advocacy for GST simplification and highlight past government actions that resulted in a fragmented ""One Nation, 9 Taxes"" approach. They argue that true GST 2.0, promised in manifestos since 2019, should involve a rational, simple structure with reduced rates on mass-consumption items, minimized compliance burdens for MSMEs, and the removal of problematic features like inverted duty structures.

Ramesh also points out that demands for an extension of the GST compensation period to states, in the spirit of cooperative federalism, have not been met—emphasizing that the GST Council’s decisions appeared predetermined, since Prime Minister Modi had foreshadowed the reforms in his Independence Day speech before the actual council meeting.

The opposition contends that the original GST design was flawed (“Growth Suppressing Tax” rather than “Good and Simple Tax”), producing disputes, compliance headaches, and hindering private investment and consumption. They welcome rate cuts, such as GST exemptions for insurance policies and reductions on a range of consumer and aspirational items (from food staples to electronics and appliances), but maintain that the reform falls short of a true GST 2.0. The ultimate impact on investment, MSMEs, and consumers, they argue, remains uncertain.

The government, meanwhile, claims that all changes were unanimously agreed upon and highlight the likely benefit to households and the middle class from reduced rates on many goods and services.",1,0,0,1,0
88,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/long-overdue-but-congress-on-gst-overhaul-takes-1-nation-9-taxes-jab-9214443,"The major reform announced by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council has eliminated the 12% and 28% slabs, leaving just two main rates – 5% and 18% – which together account for 74% of GST revenue. There is also a special 40% slab for luxury and sin goods.

The move has been described as a long overdue correction by the BJP-led central government, who say this completes the process of simplification and rationalisation started with GST's introduction in 2017. However, the Congress and several opposition parties have responded with skepticism and concern.

Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, taking a jab at the government, said: “The Modi government changed ‘One Nation, One Tax’ to ‘One Nation, Nine Taxes’.” Senior leader P Chidambaram said, “The GST design adopted in 2017 ought not to have been introduced at all. The multiple rates, cesses and surcharges made life difficult for businesses and the common man. The latest reforms should have come eight years ago.” Chidambaram argued that the reforms are being implemented now only because of rising household debt and slowing growth, as well as the political imperative of state and national elections due next year.

Opposition leaders also questioned whether states would lose revenue. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi and Tamil Nadu finance minister Thangam Thennarasu (DMK) said they welcomed corrections that would ease the burden on common people but are concerned over compensation to states. Other opposition parties, including the Trinamool Congress, quipped that the move should be called “GST 1.5”, not “GST 2.0”.

Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra said that the removal of GST on insurance premiums was done after consistent demands by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and others. Moitra said, “Full credit goes to her and other opposition leaders who persisted with the demand.”

In contrast, the government and NDA allies continued to defend the overhaul. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu called it “growth- and jobs-oriented” and Janata Dal (United) finance spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said the reform would benefit farmers, small businesses and women. Union finance ministry officials highlighted that the two-rate structure was based on sustained revenue analysis and would support critical areas of education and health.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters that the GST Council’s decisions were based on months of consultations with all states and denied that political concerns or US tariffs had anything to do with the timing.

The Congress, however, maintained that issues like clarity on state compensation, simplified compliances, tackling evasion, and protection for MSMEs were unresolved, and said the party would continue to push for a “true GST 2.0”.","The article discusses the reactions of major political parties and leaders to the GST Council’s recent overhaul of India’s tax slab structure. The Council has eliminated the 12% and 28% brackets, retaining only the 5% and 18% rates (which make up 74% of GST revenue), and set a special 40% “sin” tax for certain luxury goods. While the BJP-led central government presents the reforms as a long-overdue correction to simplify GST and stimulate the economy, the Congress party and several opposition groups express skepticism and mixed feelings.

Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge accuses the government of distorting the ""one nation, one tax"" principle, resulting in “one nation, nine taxes.” Senior leader P Chidambaram claims the prevailing GST design and past rate system “ought not to have been introduced,” and criticizes the government for making reforms “eight years too late.” He and other Congress voices suggest that the changes were a response to sluggish growth, rising household debt, and election cycles—implying that reforms were motivated by political expediency rather than public benefit.

Other opposition members, such as Shiv Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi and the DMK’s Thangam Thennarasu, cautiously welcome the correction but highlight concerns such as a potential loss of revenue for states. Opposition parties call the reform ""GST 1.5,"" stating that only time will reveal whether it will truly stimulate investment and relieve pressure on MSMEs.

Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra notes that the removal of GST on insurance premiums follows demands from various leaders, including Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, and seeks to minimize BJP’s claims of credit.

In contrast, government spokespersons and allies such as the Janata Dal United and Andhra Pradesh’s Chandrababu Naidu praise the reforms as “growth-oriented” and “pro-poor.” The Centre and Union Finance Ministry argue that retaining two main GST rates is based on revenue data, and say the overhaul is intended to benefit broad economic interests and provide relief to the middle class and sectors like education, health, and farming. The government denies political motives—such as U.S. tariffs or impending elections—play any role.

The article concludes by noting these reforms are supported by some NDA allies, with opposition scrutiny focused on implementation, state compensation, and whether real relief will reach ordinary Indians.",1,0,0,1,0
89,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/small-cars-mini-suvs-gain-momentum-gst-2-0-reforms-10229605/,"Under the next-generation reforms to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, cleared by the GST Council Wednesday, some of India’s best selling cars and motorcycles will see a reduction in tax incidence, which is expected to boost consumption in a sector which is seen as a crucial marker of the growth in the country’s economy.

The ‘GST 2,0’ reforms include a broad two-slab structure of 5 per cent and 18 per cent with a demerit rate of 40 per cent rate only for super luxury, sin and demerit goods. The aim is to lower tax burden on common people with sweeping rate cuts and reduction in GST slabs, ease blocked working capital, and facilitate ease of doing business with automated refunds and registration process.

Small cars, mini SUVs gain; bigger cars largely neutral

Small cars with engine capacity not exceeding 1200 cc (petrol) and 1500 cc (diesel) and with length not over 4 metres will now be in the 18 per cent slab, as opposed to the earlier 28 per cent slab. This means that popular hatchbacks like the Maruti Suzuki Wagon R, and mini SUVs like the Maruti Suzuki Fronx, Tata Punch and Skoda Kylaq will now be taxed at a lower rate. There is also going to be tax relief for motorcycles with engine capacity less than 350 cc and all automotive parts that will now be taxed at 18 per cent.

For petrol cars that have an engine capacity of more than 1200 cc, and diesel cars with an engine capacity of more than 1500 cc, and a length of over 4 metres, the GST rate now would be 40 per cent as against 28 per cent earlier. This segment includes some of the most popular cars in India, such as the Hyundai Creta and Toyota Fortuner.

Although, it is worth noting that while the GST on these cars will increase, the overall tax burden could be moderate because so far, these cars were subject to an additional compensation cess of 17-22 per cent, taking the total tax to 50 per cent in some cases. With the GST changes including removal of the compensation cess, the hike in base GST rate to 40 per cent will actually imply similar or slightly lower tax incidence for bigger SUVs.

“This decision will not only make vehicles more affordable across all segments, thereby boosting consumer demand, but it will also simplify the classification disputes that have long been a source of ambiguity for the industry. The discontinuance of the cess, in particular, will provide crucial support to a sector that is a vital engine of our nation’s economic growth,” said Saurabh Agarwal, Partner and Automotive Tax Leader, EY India.

Hybrids to get cheaper too

Until now, hybrid cars – which have a combination of an internal combustion engine and an electric motor – were subject to a GST of 28 per cent and compensation cess of 15 per cent, which makes the total applicable tax rate on these vehicles 43 per cent. But, with the rationalisation process, hybrid cars with an engine capacity of less than 1200 cc and a length shorter than 4 metres will attract a GST of 18 per cent, with the ones bigger than this category attracting a tax of 40 per cent.

In effect, this could push manufacturers to build smaller hybrid vehicles to take advantage of the tax benefits, and consumers are likely to purchase them due to the added advantage they offer on fuel savings. Maruti Suzuki, for instance, is learnt to be working on a hybrid version of its popular compact SUV Fronx.

In EVs, no differentiation between premium and common

The GST Council has decided to retain the concessional 5 per cent GST rate on electric vehicles (EVs), against earlier speculation that luxury end EVs could see an increase in taxes. This means domestic launches like Tata’s Harrier EV and Mahindra’s XEV 9e would be able to avoid price hikes, while imported models from companies like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, and BYD will also stay within the same concessional bracket.

“The GST Council’s move to retain a low rate for EVs is a welcome step; this brings much-needed clarity and makes our portfolio more accessible to our discerning buyers. Such reforms help stabilise the business environment and help devise strategies that benefit all stakeholders in the best possible manner,” Balbir Singh Dhillon, Head of Audi India said in a statement to The Indian Express.

Due to initial expectation that luxury end EVs could be taxed under a higher bracket following the new reforms, EV sales in August registered a 155 per cent increase over last year, as people moved to buy the vehicles anticipating an increase in prices. Internal combustion engine powered passenger vehicle sales in August declined by over 7 per cent compared to last year, as people waited for the new rates to kick in, given that there was anticipation that such cars could be taxed lower.","Complete Summary
The article outlines the impact of the GST Council's latest ""GST 2.0"" reforms on India's automotive sector, with significant changes in tax incidence designed to boost the industry and overall consumption. The new GST structure introduces two primary slabs—5% and 18%—and reserves a 40% “demerit” rate for super luxury, sin, and demerit goods. The reforms aim to lower tax burdens on consumers, simplify classifications, unlock working capital, and streamline processes such as refunds and registration.

Key impacts on vehicles:

Small cars and mini SUVs (petrol engines ≤1200 cc, diesel ≤1500 cc, and length ≤4m) move from 28% to the 18% GST slab, reducing taxes on popular models such as Maruti Suzuki Wagon R, Fronx, Tata Punch, and Skoda Kylaq.

Motorcycles with engine capacity <350 cc and all automotive parts now fall under the 18% rate.

Large cars and SUVs (petrol >1200 cc, diesel >1500 cc, and length >4m) shift to the 40% rate from the prior 28%. However, these vehicles previously attracted a 17–22% compensation cess, bringing the effective total tax to ~50%. With the elimination of this cess, the overall tax for bigger SUVs may remain similar or even decrease slightly, depending on the model (notably for Hyundai Creta, Toyota Fortuner).

Industry experts, such as Saurabh Agarwal (EY India), argue this will not only boost demand and affordability but also resolve long-standing classification ambiguities in the automotive sector.

Hybrid and Electric Vehicles:

Hybrids: Previously subject to a 28% GST plus 15% cess (totaling 43%). Under new rules, small hybrids (<1200 cc, <4m) attract 18% GST, and larger hybrids fall under 40%. This incentivises smaller, fuel-efficient hybrids and offers consumer tax savings.

Electric Vehicles (EVs): The Council retains a concessional 5% GST for all EVs, regardless of segment, averting earlier speculation that luxury EVs would lose this concession. This supports both affordable and premium EV models (e.g., Tata Harrier EV, Mahindra XEV 9e, Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, BYD) without a price increase.

Audi India’s head, Balbir Singh Dhillon, praised the reforms as providing business predictability and wider access to buyers.

Market Impact:

Anticipation of higher EV taxes had already caused a 155% surge in EV sales in August compared to the prior year; meanwhile, sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars dropped by over 7% as buyers delayed purchases, expecting more favorable GST rates for these vehicles.",0,0,0,0,0

DK Shivakumar proposes border towers to demarcate 5 new corporation in Bengaluru

TNN / Sep 04, 2025, 05:27 IST

Bengaluru: With Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) now having formally replaced Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), citizens are vexed by a question: How exactly will the limits of the five newly created city corporations be marked on the ground?
Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar has suggested installation of border towers to clearly demarcate the jurisdiction of each corporation.
Speaking at the inauguration of the GBA headquarters here on Tuesday, Shivakumar said the state will also lay the foundation stones for new municipal offices on November 1, coinciding with Kannada Rajyotsava.

""Boundary towers will be erected along the limits of all five corporations to make the divisions visible,"" he said. The move, officials say, will help citizens know which civic body to approach for services or grievances.

The initiative echoes Kempegowda's vision, who, more than four centuries ago, had marked Bengaluru's territorial limits by erecting four iconic watch towers with the Dharmarayaswamy temple as the central edifice. These include the Lalbagh (South East), Gavipura (South West), Mehkri Circle (North West), and Ulsoor (North East) towers, which continue to symbolise the city's heritage.

In 2014, BBMP had announced plans to construct Kempegowda towers on 10 major arterial roads connecting Bengaluru, with each tower estimated to cost around Rs 10 crore.
The project, though, never moved beyond announcements.
By reviving the concept in a new form, Shivakumar has drawn a symbolic link between the city's founder and Bengaluru's expansion under GBA.

He also announced major administrative restructuring under the GBA, including the addition of 300 engineers to strengthen civic works. ""We are appointing one engineer for every ward. Around 500 engineers at lower levels will ensure transparency and proper groundwork,"" Shivakumar said.

A proposal to increase the number of wards from 198 to 500 was submitted, with Rs 300 crore allocated for administrative expenses, salaries, and pensions.
""Elections must first be held in the newly formed municipalities. Only later will mergers be considered,"" the deputy CM clarified.

Name suggestions
On the demand to include Kannada words in the GBA title, deputy CM D K Shivakumar said: ""I would like to ask for advice on what name to give. The same situation had arisen in other places, including Mumbai. There is no question of ignoring the mother tongue, but if we find a good [alternative] word, let's change it.""

‘Patience' over potholes is GBA chief's mantra
As motorists continue to struggle on crater-filled roads all across the city, GBA chief commissioner Maheshwar Rao urged Bengalureans to ""be patient,"" citing multiple urban challenges delaying road repair work.

The newly appointed GBA chief, under whose jurisdiction the five new corporations operate, made the statement in response to criticism over poor execution of pothole-filling works.
Rao ruled out any issue with the quality of bitumen used for pothole repairs, saying other factors included incessant rain and overlapping activities by various agencies.

He also noted that it takes 12-24 hours for repair work to settle in once completed, but motorists begin using the roads right away, sometimes nullifying fresh repairs.","Complete Summary
The article reports on Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar’s proposal to erect border towers to clearly demarcate the limits of the five newly created city corporations in Bengaluru, replacing the former Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) with the new Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA). Shivakumar announced the initiative at the inauguration of the GBA headquarters, noting that boundary towers would make the divisions easily visible and help residents identify the correct civic body for services and complaints.

This move draws on historical symbolism: Kempegowda, Bengaluru’s founder, had similarly demarcated the city’s boundaries centuries ago with iconic watch towers. Shivakumar also referred to an earlier, unrealized 2014 BBMP proposal to build Kempegowda towers on arterial roads.

Further administrative reforms under the GBA were announced, including adding 300 engineers for ward-level civic work supervision and increasing the number of municipal wards from 198 to 500, with a Rs 300 crore budget allocated for administration, salaries, and pensions. Shivakumar clarified that municipal elections must be completed before considering the merger of any corporations.

The article also touches on the discussion about including Kannada language in the new GBA’s name, with Shivakumar open to suggestions but asserting the importance of the mother tongue.

The article concludes with comments from the new GBA chief commissioner Maheshwar Rao, who urged the public to be patient about pothole repairs, attributing delays to persistent rain and the complexity of coordinating multiple urban agencies. Rao insisted that the quality of materials used was not the issue, and that repaired roads need time to settle before vehicles use them.",0,0,0,1,0

The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit left the tariffs in place for now, but the administration nevertheless called on the high court to intervene quickly in a petition filed electronically late Wednesday and provided to The Associated Press.

It was expected to be formally docketed on Thursday.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to take up the case and hear arguments in early November.

“That decision casts a pall of uncertainty upon ongoing foreign negotiations that the President has been pursuing through tariffs over the past five months, jeopardizing both already negotiated framework deals and ongoing negotiations,” he wrote. “The stakes in this case could not be higher.”

But the stakes are also high for small businesses battered by tariffs and uncertainty, said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center.

“These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,” he said.

The businesses have twice prevailed, once at a federal court focused on trade and again with the appeals court's 7-4 ruling.

The tariffs and their erratic rollout have shaken global markets, alienated U.S. trading partners and allies and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.

Most judges on the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, did not let Trump usurp congressional power to set tariffs. The dissenters, though, said the law does allow the president to regulate importation during emergencies without explicit limitations.

The ruling involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency: the tariffs first announced in April and the ones from February on imports from Canada, China and Mexico.

The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But over the decades, lawmakers have ceded authority to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.

Some Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, weren’t covered by the appeals court ruling. It also does not include tariffs Trump imposed on China in his first term that were kept by Democratic President Joe Biden.

S President Donald Trump has directed the Department of Defence to strengthen preparations aimed at deterring Russia and China, according to Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth.

He said that Washington does not seek confrontation with either country, but wants to maintain a strong deterrence posture.
Speaking to Fox News, Hegseth connected Beijing’s recent military parade -- attended by the leaders of China, Russia and North Korea -- to what he called the shortcomings of the previous US administration.

""Unfortunately, the weakness of the previous administration has driven Russia and China closer together. That's a terrible development of a lack of American leadership,"" Hegseth said. ""But that’s why President Trump has charged us at the Defence Department to be prepared, to rebuild our military in historic ways, to restore the warrior ethos and re-establish deterrence. Not because we seek conflict, we do not.""

Hegseth stressed that US preparations are defensive in nature, adding, ""We've made that clear to China, Russia and other countries. It's because being prepared prevents conflict.""
US STRATEGY CENTRED ON MILITARY ADVANTAGE

""So we know what they believe and who they are. We also know how strong we are and what military advantages we have. They also know this,"" Hegseth said.

""Our task is to maintain these military advantages in space, in the air, at sea, underwater and with long-range weapons. All of our capabilities, 'Golden Dome', that China knows it cannot replicate, and we will do so within this administration,"" he added.

While Beijing and Moscow have sought to project unity in the face of Western influence, Hegseth said, ""Demonstrations and parades are good, but the United States hopes they will not manifest themselves in the form of a real military conflict.""

Despite the strong rhetoric on deterrence, Hegseth pointed out that President Trump values diplomatic channels with Beijing.

""Trump has a great relationship with President Xi, and he will use that to hopefully find ways to cooperate,"" Hegseth said.
BEIJING PARADE MARKS WWII ANNIVERSARY

The military parade that triggered Hegseth’s comments took place in Beijing on September 3 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of China’s victory over Japan in World War II.
The parade itself was a dazzling show of strength -- Xi, dressed in a Mao-style tunic, rode past ranks of troops and cutting-edge weaponry, from hypersonic missiles to underwater drones. Fighter jets roared overhead, helicopters carried vast banners, and 80,000 “peace” birds were released into the skies.

Chinese President Xi Jinping was joined by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The three leaders were seated next to one another, signalling a display of solidarity amid mounting tensions with the West.","Complete Summary

Speaking on Fox News, Hegseth attributes the increasing closeness between Russia and China to the perceived weaknesses of the prior U.S. administration, labeling it a failure of American leadership. He explains that the Trump administration is “rebuilding the military in historic ways” to restore American military ethos and ensure credible deterrence. According to Hegseth, such preparations are defensive and intended to prevent—not provoke—conflict, and this is “made clear” to both adversaries and allies.

Hegseth further elaborates that the essence of U.S. military strategy is maintaining an advantage across all domains: space, air, sea, underwater, and long-range weaponry. He touts U.S. capabilities (including reference to “Golden Dome”—possibly symbolic of a layered defense system) that China “cannot replicate,” asserting that these will be preserved under the Trump administration.

Despite the strong language regarding military readiness, Hegseth points out Trump values diplomatic engagement, describing a “great relationship” with China’s President Xi Jinping and expressing hope for cooperation.

In a Facebook post, the restaurant owners, Raman Kaur and Narinder Singh Athwa, said that the incident took place on August 30. The two groups arrived just 15 minutes after booking a table. They enjoyed a lavish spread of curries, sides, and children’s meals. But when it came time to settle the bill, the women and children allegedly left, leaving two men behind. The men claimed that they had “no way of paying” and left shortly after.

In the Facebook post, the couple explained that the two customers promised a payment would be made by Monday, but have failed to live up to their promise.

“We hate to do this but it’s our only option at this point. Unfortunately on Saturday night we had a table of 2 families, who after eating, drinking & enjoying themselves tried 5 different cards, calling various people to transfer money paid £0 off a £200 bill!! Now we don’t want to start discriminating as we have families from the same community who come in regularly and we’ve never had a problem. These were new visitors, rang up to book, 4 adults + 4 children. Apart from the normal ruckus that infants can cause wanting to run around, we had no trouble from any of them,” the Facebook post read.

“The only issue came at the end when the families scarpered and the 2 men said sorry we have no way of paying. When I requested ID they couldn’t produce any either. No cash, nothing,” it continued.

“A name & number was left with an apology & the promise to pay today after they were paid and a promise that if they didn’t pay we could release cctv images of them across socials,” the couple wrote.

The post has drawn a flood of local support, with many suggesting the owners involve the police or release the CCTV footage. Some users also advised taking deposits or card details up front.

“Report this incident to the police firstly and I would definitely shared the CCTV so others businesses are warned.. Hope you get the bill paid!” one user commented.

He expressed confidence in a favorable outcome while noting the potential economic consequences of rescinding tariffs.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday warned that the United States might need to “unwind” trade agreements with the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and others if it loses a tariffs case currently heading to the Supreme Court, as reported by Reuters.

He added that a defeat could cause the country “to suffer so greatly.”

Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said his administration plans to challenge a recent US appeals court decision that ruled many of his tariffs were unlawful. Despite the setback, he expressed confidence that the Supreme Court would ultimately side with his administration, Reuters reported.

""We made a deal with the European Union where they're paying us almost a trillion dollars. And you know what? They're happy. It's done. These deals are all done,"" he said. “I guess we'd have to unwind them.”

These remarks marked the first time Trump explicitly suggested that trade agreements with major partners negotiated separately from the tariffs could be invalidated if the Supreme Court upholds last Friday's ruling.

He argued that reversing the tariffs would be financially damaging.

However, trade experts point out that the tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, not foreign companies, and economists have warned that such duties tend to drive up inflation domestically.

“Our country has a chance to be unbelievably rich again. It could also be unbelievably poor again. If we don't win that case, our country is going to suffer so greatly, so greatly,” Trump said.

The appeals court ruling addressed the legality of what Trump calls “reciprocal” tariffs first imposed as part of a trade war in April, as well as a separate set of tariffs imposed in February against China, Canada and Mexico. The decision does not impact tariffs issued under other legal authority, such as those on steel and aluminium imports.

Trade experts said his comments on the cost of rescinding the tariffs were intended to convince the Supreme Court that removing the tariffs would unleash major economic chaos, Reuters reported.

Reuters reported that Ryan Majerus, a former senior US trade official who is now a partner with law firm King & Spalding, said it had been clear from the start that the trade deals with the EU and other trading partners were framework agreements that were subject to change, not fully fledged trade agreements.

“The president’s announcement today that the deals could be unwound reflects an effort to maximise leverage on the U.S. side,” he said.

Legal and trade experts say the Supreme Court's 6-3 majority of Republican-appointed justices may slightly improve Trump's odds of keeping in place at least some of the tariffs after the appeals court ruled 7-4 last week that they are illegal.

But they say it is difficult to predict exactly what the court will do, given rulings in past cases and the unprecedented nature of the challenge.","President Donald Trump has warned that the United States may be forced to “unwind” or retract trade agreements with major partners—such as the European Union, Japan, and South Korea—if the Supreme Court upholds a recent appeals court ruling that many of his administration’s tariffs are unlawful. Trump expressed confidence in a favorable outcome from the Supreme Court, but also cautioned that losing the case could have devastating economic consequences, arguing it would “cause the country to suffer so greatly.”

These statements were made following a U.S. appeals court decision that concluded many of Trump’s tariffs did not follow legal procedures, though tariffs under other authorities—like those on steel and aluminum—would not be affected. In his comments, Trump highlighted that his negotiated deals, especially with the EU, were tied to tariff policies and suggested they may lose validity if the tariffs are struck down.

Trade experts countered Trump’s arguments: they point out that tariffs are paid by U.S. importers (and ultimately, American consumers) rather than foreign companies, and that tariffs often fuel domestic inflation rather than directly boosting state revenues. Some experts, like Ryan Majerus, confirmed that the agreements in question were always subject to change and not comprehensive trade pacts.

Trump’s rhetoric is interpreted as an attempt to apply pressure to the Supreme Court by emphasizing the potential economic disruption if the tariffs are rescinded. Observers note that the current Supreme Court’s 6-3 Republican majority could modestly improve Trump’s chances of sustaining his tariffs, although outcomes remain unpredictable given the novel legal circumstances.",1,0,0,1,0

Hours after his allegation that Russia, China and North Korea were 'conspiring' against the US, President Donald Trump on Wednesday took a U-turn and said that he has a 'very good' relationship with 'all of them'.

Trump's remarks came against the backdrop of Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un being seen taking part in China's victory parade with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. In the visuals that surfaced from the parade, the three leaders were seen sharing camaraderie.

The US President took a swipe at Xi and accused him of a plot to ""conspire against the United States of America"".

Later, during a bilateral meeting at the Oval Office, Trump hailed the Chinese military parade as a ""beautiful ceremony"", saying that it was very impressive. He alleged that the parade was done to grab his attention, which Trump said he acknowledged.

""When they did what they did, I thought it was a beautiful ceremony; it was very impressive, but I understood the reason they were doing it: they were hoping I was watching, and I was watching,"" Trump told reporters.

He further said, ""My relationship with all of them is very good, and we are going to find out how good it is over the next week or two.""

Referring to Xi Jinping's speech at the victory parade, Trump pressed that the US should have been mentioned by the Chinese President.

""I think we helped China very much when they talk about freedom, and I don't believe that the US was acknowledged for helping China to gain its freedom... I heard President Xi last night, and I think the US should have been mentioned since we helped China very much,"" he added.

Xi Jinping had termed China ""unstoppable"" in his speech at the event, assuring the country's commitment to peaceful development.

September 3 is observed as the anniversary of what China describes as its victory in the struggle against Japanese aggression in 1945, when Japan was defeated in World War II.
‘North Korea, China, Russia conspiring against US’

Ahead of the victory parade in Beijing, Trump, while accusing China of 'conspiring', had wondered whether the US would be mentioned in President Xi's speech.

""The big question to be answered is whether or not President Xi of China will mention the massive amount of support and “blood” that The United States of America gave to China in order to help it to secure its FREEDOM from a very unfriendly foreign invader. Many Americans died in China’s quest for Victory and Glory. I hope that they are rightfully Honored and Remembered for their Bravery and Sacrifice!"" he posted on Truth Social.

""May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP,"" his post read.
Russia responds to Trump's ‘conspire’ charge

Meanwhile, Russia reacted to the US President's 'conspiring' charge, with Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov saying, ""We hope he was ironical"".

Ushakov added that North Korea, Russia and China have not conspired against the US. ""I would like to say that no one has been conspiring, no one has been plotting anything, no conspiracies,"" he said.

The Kremlin further said, ""I can say that everyone understands the role played by the United States, the current administration of President Trump and President Trump personally in the current international situation.""","The article documents a series of statements and diplomatic exchanges following the appearance of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un together at a Chinese military “victory parade” in Beijing—a high-profile event commemorating the end of WWII in the Asia-Pacific. Initially, US President Donald Trump accused China, Russia, and North Korea of “conspiring” against the United States, especially after seeing the three leaders sharing apparent camaraderie during the festivities.

However, Trump later changed his tone. In subsequent remarks at the Oval Office, he called the Beijing parade a “beautiful ceremony” and “very impressive,” claiming that it was staged to catch his attention and noting, “I was watching.” Trump insisted that his relationship with Xi, Putin, and Kim was “very good” and hinted that the real test of these ties would emerge “over the next week or two.”

Trump also critiqued Xi Jinping’s parade speech for failing to acknowledge America’s role in helping China achieve victory and freedom during WWII, asserting that the US significantly contributed “blood” and resources and should be recognized for its sacrifices.

Chinese President Xi, meanwhile, described China as “unstoppable” and committed to peaceful development in his speech. The “conspiring” charge elicited a public response from Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, who hoped Trump was being ironic and denied that China, Russia, or North Korea were plotting against the US. The Kremlin also acknowledged the US role in shaping the current international environment.

A federal judge on Wednesday (September 3, 2025) ruled that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration unlawfully terminated about $2.2 billion in grants awarded to Harvard University and can no longer cut off research funding to the prestigious Ivy League school.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston marked a major legal victory for Harvard as it seeks to cut a deal that could bring an end to the White House's multi-front conflict with the nation's oldest and richest university.

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based school became a central focus of the administration's broad campaign to leverage federal funding to force change at U.S. universities, which Mr. Trump says are gripped by antisemitic and ""radical left"" ideologies.

Among the earliest actions the administration took against Harvard was to cancel hundreds of grants awarded to university researchers on the grounds that the school failed to do enough to address harassment of Jewish students on its campus.

Harvard sued, arguing the Trump administration was retaliating against it in violation of its free-speech rights after it refused to meet officials' demands that it cede control over who it hires and who it teaches.

Judge Burroughs, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, said the Republican President was right to combat antisemitism and that Harvard was ""wrong to tolerate hateful behaviour as long as it did.""

But she said fighting antisemitism was not the administration's true aim and that officials wanted to pressure Harvard to accede to its demands in violation of its free-speech rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.

Judge Burroughs said it was the job of courts to safeguard academic freedom and ""ensure that important research is not improperly subjected to arbitrary and procedurally infirm grant terminations, even if doing so risks the wrath of a government committed to its agenda no matter the cost.""

She barred the administration from terminating or freezing any additional federal funding to Harvard and blocked it from continuing to withhold payment on existing grants or refusing to award new funding to the school in the future.

Harvard and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The decision came a week after Mr. Trump during an August 26 Cabinet meeting renewed his call for Harvard to settle with the administration and pay ""nothing less than $500 million,"" saying the school had ""been very bad.""

Three other Ivy League schools have made deals with the administration, including Columbia University, which in July agreed to pay $220 million to restore federal research money that had been denied because of allegations the university allowed antisemitism to fester on campus.

COMMENT | ‘David Harvard’ versus ‘Goliath Trump’

As with Columbia, the Trump administration took actions against Harvard related to the pro-Palestinian protest movement that roiled its campus and other universities in the wake of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and Israel's war in Gaza.

Harvard has said it has taken steps to ensure its campus is welcoming to Jewish and Israeli students, who it acknowledges experienced ""vicious and reprehensible"" treatment following the onset of Israel's war in Gaza.

The administration's decision to cancel grants was one of many actions it has taken against Harvard. It has also sought to bar international students from attending the school; threatened Harvard's accreditation status; and opened the door to cutting off more funds by finding it violated federal civil rights law.

Judge Burroughs in a separate case has already barred the administration from halting Harvard's ability to host international students, who comprise about a quarter of the school's student body.","A federal judge in Boston, Allison Burroughs, has ruled that the Trump administration unlawfully terminated around $2.2 billion in federal research grants to Harvard University and barred the government from cutting off further funding. This decision marks a significant legal victory for Harvard as it faces ongoing conflict with the Trump White House, which has been pressuring U.S. universities for alleged tolerance of antisemitism and “radical left” ideologies.

The administration initially targeted Harvard by canceling hundreds of grants, citing a perceived failure to address harassment of Jewish students. Harvard filed suit, arguing that this was retaliation infringing its free-speech rights, and refusing demands to cede control over hiring and curriculum decisions. Judge Burroughs noted that while combating antisemitism is legitimate, the administration’s true motive was to force Harvard to capitulate to its demands, violating First Amendment protections.

The judge emphasized that safeguarding academic freedom—and ensuring that vital research funding is not arbitrarily terminated by executive action—was a key responsibility of the courts, “even if doing so risks the wrath of a government committed to its agenda no matter the cost.” Burroughs barred the administration from further withholding payments or refusing to award new federal grants to Harvard.

This conflict fits a broader pattern: three other Ivy League institutions—including Columbia University, which paid $220 million to restore its funding—have made deals with the Trump administration amid similar charges. The administration’s pressure tactics were intensified after pro-Palestinian protests swept universities following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack and subsequent war in Gaza. Harvard acknowledged “vicious and reprehensible” treatment experienced by Jewish and Israeli students and claimed it has taken action to make campus more welcoming.

The administration has also sought to block international student attendance, threatened Harvard’s accreditation, and opened further civil rights investigations. Judge Burroughs, in a separate ruling, already halted efforts to prevent Harvard from hosting international students.",1,0,0,1,0

At the 2025 Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders from the 10-member bloc held day-long deliberations on the group’s future direction. Chinese President Xi Jinping welcomed leaders at the summit’s opening.

In his address, PM Modi emphasized three core pillars guiding India’s approach to the SCO: security, connectivity, and opportunity. He highlighted that India has suffered from terrorism for decades, specifically referencing the recent Pahalgam attack, and thanked nations that stood by India after the tragedy.

Modi forcefully asserted that there can be “no double standards” on terrorism—criticizing countries that openly or tacitly support or tolerate terrorism. He called for the SCO to adopt a unanimous and unequivocal stance, warning that terrorism is a universal threat going beyond any single nation.

He outlined that security, peace, and stability form the bedrock of a country’s development, but persistent threats like terrorism, extremism, and separatism endanger this foundation. Modi detailed India’s leadership in regional and international counterterrorism initiatives, including action against Al Qaeda and efforts to combat terror financing, expressing gratitude for fellow nations’ support in such measures.

On connectivity, Modi underlined that projects which bypass the sovereignty of nations (implicitly referencing China’s Belt and Road Initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) undermine trust. He instead highlighted India-backed connectivity projects like the Chabahar Port and the International North-South Transport Corridor that aim to foster ties with Afghanistan and Central Asia while respecting sovereignty.",1,0,0,1,0

The 76-year-old picked up. The person at the other end was a woman; she said she was from a telecom firm and transferred the call to the Mumbai Police Crime Branch.

A ‘‘police officer’ then picked up. What he said left Devi reeling — he accused her of allegedly funding terrorists involved in the deadly Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.

Over the next 24 days, the elderly woman was forced to transfer her life’s savings — over Rs 43 lakh — to “prove her innocence”. It was only later that she realised she had been scammed.

According to her complaint filed with the Cyber Crime Police Station in Noida’s Sector 36, Devi stated that the caller initially claimed to be a representative from the head office of a major telecom company.

“The caller told me that a phone number under my name was registered in Mumbai’s Byculla and that it was being used for illegal activities — gambling and blackmailing. She then connected me to the Mumbai Police Crime Branch, who, she said, will explain what to do next. She said I would need to submit a clearance certificate to them,” Devi said in her complaint.

Devi was then allegedly connected to someone posing as an ACP from the Mumbai Police Crime Branch. The ‘officer’ warned her that an arrest warrant had been issued in her name, citing alleged involvement in hawala transactions and terror financing. He claimed her name had also surfaced in connection with funding terrorists behind the recent Pahalgam attacks.

“I am a 76-year-old woman… a widow living alone… I was afraid and under mental and psychological pressure. They wanted me to give all my bank account details and deposit security money to avoid arrest… they said it would be refunded after due enquiry in the case,” her complaint stated.

Under pressure and fearing legal action, the complainant told police she was instructed to “verify” her accounts and transfer funds for clearance certificates.

Between July 20 and August 13, police said Devi transferred around Rs 43 lakh in eight transactions through RTGS, IMPS, and QR codes from her HDFC, Karnataka Bank and Post Office accounts. The money was routed to multiple accounts.

Police said the cyber fraudsters kept pressuring her to deposit more money, making threatening WhatsApp and video calls while impersonating senior police officers. Despite already parting with her life savings, she alleged that they continued to demand an additional Rs 15 lakh.

“It is only after she was able to contact a lawyer she knew that she realised she was being scammed, and stopped engaging with the fraudsters,” police said.
In her complaint, Devi stated that the scam not only ruined her financially but also caused severe mental stress and health problems. “The whole episode has shattered me, including my mental and physical health, in addition to losing all my finances and putting me in great trouble,” she wrote, urging the police to prosecute the accused and give them “exemplary punishment”.

The Noida Police has registered a case under sections 308(2) (extortion), 318(4) (cheating), and 319(2) (cheating by personation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and Section 66D of the IT Act.

The authorities have closed all educational institutions in the region while the Srinagar-Jammu national highway, the only road link connecting Kashmir with the rest of the country, is closed for vehicular traffic.

Jammu and Kashmir has been witnessing continuous rainfall since yesterday. While it was raining in Jammu region from the morning, it started raining in the Valley from the evening. A MeT official said significant rainfall has been recorded in J&K since yesterday 8.30 am till 5.30 am today.

Many areas in the Kashmir valley witnessed a fresh spell of rain. In south Kashmir, Qazigund in Kulgam district recorded 90.6 mm followed by Kokernag (89 mm) and Pahalgam (64.4 mm) in Anantnag district while Srinagar experienced 46.1 mm of rainfall during the past 27 hours ending 11.30 am.

Due to the continuous rainfall, the water level in Chenab in Jammu region and Jhelum in Kashmir has increased. While the water in Chenab in Jammu and Udhampur has crossed the danger level and flood alarm mark in Jammu region, the water level is increasing in Jhelum in the Valley. The water level in Vaishow nallah in south Kashmir has risen significantly i due to continuous rainfall.

At 1 pm, the Jhelum's upstream gauge reading at Sangam in Anantnag was close to the danger mark of 25 feet and downstream at Ram Munshibagh in Srinagar was almost 17 feet, just one feet below the alert level and four feet below the danger mark.

According to independent weather forecaster Aadil Maqbool, the Vaishow nallah, Sheshnag Nallah and Lidder Nallah in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district have already crossed the danger mark. He said water levels of Jhelum at Ram Munshi Bagh in Srinagar are likely to cross the flood declaration mark today due to incessant rainfall.

He added that there would be no major improvement in weather condition till evening and downpour is likely to persist until then. “Some parts of Jammu and south Kashmir are likely to receive another round of heavy rainfall and the same is expected over central and few parts of north Kashmir,” Aadil said.

Authorities in Jammu have launched a multi-agency operation to shore up embankments near the damaged fourth bridge on the swollen Tawi river to prevent flooding in low-lying areas. Heavy rain on August 26 damaged the road near the bridge, leaving vehicles stranded. Police warned that a breach could inundate nearby localities, housing around 7,000 people and the Nehru Warehouse business hub. Residents have shifted women, children, and the elderly to safer places as a precaution.

Army engineers and civil agencies have covered the breach with waterproof sheets and sealed the damaged stretch with barbed wire. The fourth bridge has been closed again following rising waters. Jammu city also faces landslides on the Panjitirthi-Sidhra road, mudslides on the Manda-Nagrota stretch, and closure of a bridge on the Chenab at Akhnoor, cutting off key routes. Two houses collapsed in old Jammu, but three trapped persons were rescued.

In the wake of continuous rainfall, authorities have ordered closure of all educational institutions in the UT as a precautionary measure. Besides, all examinations scheduled for the day have been cancelled.

“In view of prevailing weather conditions in Kashmir, levels are rising in water bodies and rains are expected to continue till mid-day as per IMD. Field teams of administration are closely monitoring the situation and contingency plans are in place. People are advised to exercise caution and not venture near water bodies,” Divisional Commissioner Kashmir Anshul Garg said.

The closure of the Srinagar-Jammu national highway has worsened the situation, with the Valley facing a spike in prices of fruits, vegetables and other essentials. The highway remains the crucial supply line for the region.

Jammu and Kashmir, especially Jammu region, has been battered by rains since mid-August and over 150 people have died in cloudbursts, landslides and flash floods triggered by heavy rains in the region. Thousands of residential houses, bridges, roads and other infrastructure have been damaged, mostly in Jammu. The region is now bracing for another flood-like situation.

The administration has advised people to stay alert and avoid venturing near water bodies. The MeT has also warned of heavy rains and the possibility of cloudbursts, landslides and flash floods at vulnerable places due to incessant rains.

At least 13 dead, including nine in landslide on Vaishno Devi route as heavy rains wreak havoc across Jammu

In Anantnag district, police rescued 25 nomadic families stranded under a bridge due to rise in the water level.

Chief Minister Omar Abdullah reviewed the situation arising from the incessant rains at a meeting, the CM's office said in a post on X.

Abdullah directed the administration to intensify the ground response, ensure clearance of waterlogged areas, safeguard essential services, carry out timely evacuations in critical zones, and provide immediate relief.

Officials said the incessant rains claimed the life of a mother-daughter in Kangri village of Sunderbani in Rajouri district early Wednesday.

The two died after the roof of their house collapsed.

At least 40 persons were trapped in Garkhal village of Akhnoor due to overflowing of river Chenab which was flowing four feet above the evacuation level of 42 feet this morning, the officials said, adding State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and police teams have been rushed to the village for shifting them to safety.

Emergency helplines have been established in various police station areas of south Kashmir where the water level is rising significantly in the water bodies.

Police and civil administration have issued advisories to the general public, urging them not to venture close to water bodies in view of the inclement weather.

Four shuttle trains running between Jammu and Katra to help locals and stranded pilgrims were suspended on Wednesday due to heavy rain and flooding of tracks. The services, launched on September 1 and scheduled till September 15, were cancelled as rail traffic in the Jammu division remains disrupted for nine days following flash floods and track damage on August 26. Special trains have so far ferried 5,784 stranded passengers. The Vaishno Devi pilgrimage also remained suspended for the ninth day.","Jammu and Kashmir is on high alert due to a significant flood threat following continuous and heavy rainfall throughout the region. Water levels in major rivers and streams—including the Chenab and Jhelum—have surged, with some gauges nearing or surpassing danger marks, and several nallahs in south Kashmir already above critical levels.

The relentless downpour has led authorities to close all educational institutions and cancel exams. The Srinagar-Jammu national highway, a lifeline for supplies into the Kashmir Valley, has been closed, triggering a spike in the cost of essentials and further isolating the area. In south Kashmir, rainfall totals have been especially high, with major towns like Qazigund, Kokernag, and Pahalgam recording upwards of 60–90 mm in the past day.

Jammu city has seen a multi-agency emergency response: embankments along the swollen Tawi river are being reinforced, and residents living near vulnerable areas have been evacuated. Landslides and mudslides have occurred across several major roads and bridges, displacing families and making travel hazardous or impossible in key regions.

The region has recently been battered by deadly cloudbursts, landslides, and flash floods, with over 150 deaths reported since mid-August and widespread damage to houses, infrastructure, and agricultural land. Emergency advisories warn people to avoid water bodies and unstable ground, with local disaster response, police, and the Army assisting in evacuations and relief operations.

The pilgrimage to the Vaishno Devi shrine remains suspended for the ninth consecutive day as train and road links have been disrupted by floods and damaged tracks. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has reviewed the flood response, instructing the administration to intensify relief efforts, secure essential services, and coordinate evacuations in critical areas. Emergency helplines have been set up across affected districts.

Tragically, there have been further casualties—such as a mother and daughter killed by a house roof collapse and dozens stranded by the rising Chenab waters. Relief and rescue are ongoing while the weather forecast continues to predict more rain and possible cloudbursts, suggesting that the threat remains acute in the coming days.",0,0,0,0,0

The Union Territory (UT) was facing a severe fiscal crisis as its public revenues had “collapsed” in the aftermath of the April 22 terror attack in which 26 people were killed, he said.

Mr. Abdullah, who also holds the finance portfolio, told the 56th GST Council meeting in Delhi, that major economic sectors, including tourism, handicrafts, agriculture and horticulture, had come to a standstill after the attack.

Proposed GST reforms could further reduce the UT’s revenue by 10 to 12%, the Chief Minister said.

He was of the view that the GST Council could go ahead with rate rationalisation proposals, but suitable mechanisms should be devised to compensate states as well as UTs.

The Centre’s support to Jammu and Kashmir to deal with the fiscal crisis was critical, Mr. Abdullah emphasised.

“The major sectors of the economy, like tourism, transport, construction, and automobiles, have come to a standstill post April 2025. The proposed reform can further reduce our GST revenues by 10-12%.

“Hence, as the Finance Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, I am of the opinion that establishing suitable mechanisms and safeguards for the fiscal stability of States and UT’s is critical,” he said.

He highlighted the devastating impact of the event on the UT’s economy and called for the Centre’s support to deal with the situation, particularly in view of the proposed GST rate rationalisation.

“We may go ahead with the rate rationalisation proposal, while devising a mechanism for compensating States/UTs for their fiscal stability and creating safeguards for translating the benefits from rationalisation in the reduced prices to the masses of our country,” he said.

Mr. Abdullah stated that the GST reforms must consider the unique challenges faced by individual states and UTs.

He detailed how the local economy had been gaining renewed vigour before being “shocked” by the “Pahalgam incident” of April 2025. This event, and its aftermath, have brought major economic sectors—including tourism, handicraft, horticulture, and agriculture — to a standstill.

The Chief Minister also urged Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman-headed GST Council to address the “geopolitical challenges” facing the country and the severe fiscal pressures on his region following the terror attack.

He talked about substantial loss of jobs and businesses, and a decline in public revenues. “Today, all the sectors of economic activity, including tourism, handicraft, horticulture and agriculture, are badly affected. The flight of non-local workers has slowed down development of infrastructure projects,” the Chief Minister said.

Fully endorsing the two-tier (5 and 18%) GST structure proposal, the Chief Minister said, “My main concern is how do we ensure that this rate rationalisation eases the burden on the common man and makes these specific goods and services more affordable for the masses of our country.

“These often lead to classification disputes, inverted duty structures and compliance complexity. The recommendations of the Group of Ministers and the Union proposal deal with these distortions to a large extent and aim to minimise such aberrations. For the Trade and Industries, these will bring clarity, reduce litigation, and enhance compliance. Hence, I welcome and support the recommendations of the Group,” he said.

“We need to have systemic safeguards to assure us that the proposed rate changes result in major benefits for the consumers and are not cornered in the chain. There should not be any scope for profiteering from this rate rationalisation,” Mr. Abdullah said.

The Chief Minister also touched upon national economic issues, noting that the country’s growth path is “suddenly challenged by geopolitical challenges” and also pointed to “whimsical trade policies of the colonial era” that he said could restrict India’s access to 20% of the global market, affecting thousands of workers in sectors like agriculture, handicraft, and gems and jewellery.

Asserting that the GST, introduced in July 2017, remains the most ambitious federal tax reform in India’s fiscal history, he said that through these eight years, several steps and initiatives have been taken in tax structure, administrative mechanism, and technology frontier to improve efficiency and revenue mobilisation from GST, as also to facilitate honest taxpayers and dealers.

“The past year has been nothing but challenging for Jammu and Kashmir and for the entire nation. At the national level, we see our growth path suddenly challenged by geopolitical challenges.

“Our economy is steadily accelerating at a 6–7% growth rate. We have increased our export competitiveness and raised our share in global markets in goods and in services.

“Our forex reserves had quadrupled to $660 billion in the past two decades. But today we seek our market access being severely constrained by whimsical trade policies of the colonial era,” he said.

The Chief Minister said these policies will deprive us of about 20% of the global market and will seriously affect thousands of workers and entrepreneurs in the agriculture, handicraft, marine products, gems and jewellery sectors. ","Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah highlighted the severe economic impact of the April 22, 2025, Pahalgam terror attack during a GST Council meeting in Delhi. He described how the attack, which killed 26 people, led to a near-collapse of the Union Territory’s public revenues and brought key economic sectors such as tourism, handicrafts, agriculture, and horticulture to a standstill. Abdullah, who also serves as finance minister, warned that the proposed GST rate rationalisation reforms could further reduce Jammu and Kashmir’s revenues by 10–12%, aggravating the region's fiscal crisis.

Abdullah called on the central government to provide economic support and emphasized the need for mechanisms to compensate both states and UTs facing similar crises—especially as new GST reforms are implemented. He fully supported the two-tier GST structure (5% and 18%) but insisted on the importance of safeguards that would ensure the financial benefits actually reach consumers rather than being absorbed elsewhere in the supply chain. He also urged against profiteering and stressed the need to minimize classification disputes and compliance complexity through the reforms.

The Chief Minister detailed how Jammu and Kashmir’s economy had been recovering before the terror attack, which caused job losses, halted infrastructure development, and led to a flight of migrant workers. He further noted the broader national context, pointing to India’s overall economic progress and warning that sudden geopolitical challenges—including restrictive foreign trade policies reminiscent of the “colonial era”—could cut off India’s access to 20% of the world market, harming sectors such as agriculture, handicrafts, and gems and jewellery.

Abdullah concluded by reaffirming support for GST as India’s major federal tax reform but cautioned that regional vulnerabilities and external shocks must be factored into national policy and compensation mechanisms.",1,0,0,1,0

This was very different from the beginning of her career, when she had faced stiff opposition and condemnation.

A new movie called Songs of Paradise, starring Saba Azaad and Soni Razdaan and streaming on Amazon Prime, is loosely based on the life of Raj Begum, also called the Nightingale of Kashmir. The film has been directed by Danish Renzu of Half Widow (2018) fame.

Raj Begum was the first woman singer to perform on Radio Kashmir (now All India Radio, Srinagar). Few artists from Jammu and Kashmir have bridged divides the way Raj Begum did, her songs flowing as a common thread through all the communities that have called the Valley home.
Raj Begum: Early life and discovery of her voice

Born in 1927 in Magarmal Bagh in Srinagar as Rehti, and raised in a poor and conservative family, Raj Begum was married very early to a businessman named Mohommad Abdullah. She never went to school, could not read or write, and had no training in music. But she would often sing at weddings across communities to help her family.

Her voice was heard one day by Ghulam Qadir Langoo, a Radio Kashmir staff artiste, singer and sarangi player who was once a court musician for Maharaja Hari Singh. In 1950, Langoo had been tasked with looking for women singers for the newly established radio station, and was walking the streets on this quest.

He chose to walk around the relatively impoverished area as singing and the performing arts were considered the vocation of “the lower classes, like my family,” Langoo once said in an interview with Kashmir Life.

For the conservative Kashmiri society of the time, singing outside of one’s home, especially for women, was not considered respectable. It took a while for Langoo to convince Rehti’s father and husband to let her sing. He also offered her daughter’s name to be used instead of hers, so that no one knew who was singing on the radio. It was Langoo who trained her in melody and diction.

“Scared, clandestinely, we went to the radio station. People despised us, saying we were shameless. They believed their daughters would follow us and bring them shame…we fought the taboos. We (she and Naseem Akhtar, who joined after her) stayed firm and pursued,” Raj Begum says in the NFDC documentary Raj Begum: The Melody Queen of Kashmir.

Kashmiri singer and composer Waheed Jeelani, in a conversation with The Indian Express, calls her decision to sing “pathbreaking”. “It was quite courageous of her. She faced social boycott and yet continued to sing. It was not just that it was a woman’s voice, it was a blazing and passionate voice that reached us and Kashmir listened intently,” he says.
Impact of Raj Begum’s voice on Kashmir

When Raj Begum walked inside the broadcasting station and sang Gulrez (Scattered Flowers), a love story translated from Persian by eminent Kashmiri poet Maqbool Shah Kralawari, her soulful rendition struck a chord.

The longing in Dil chooran hai, dil nivum shaman (The one who stole my heart in the cover of darkness), the sense of loss in Rum gayem sheehshass (My mirror split), lingered in the hearts of Kashmiris.

One of her most famous pieces was Mashravthas janan (My love, you’ve forgotten me), a poem by Kashmiri poet Rasa Javidani. It was the lament of a father whose son was lost to Pakistan during Partition, and still resonates in the collective memory of many Kashmiris.

“Raj Begum thawed the long-frozen cultural heritage of Kashmir. Our cultural ethos had become dormant… Raj Begum’s voice awakened it,” says poet and novelist Ghulam Nabi Gauhar in the NFDC documentary.

From criticism to earning respect, Raj Begum’s journey paved the way for a slew of female singers who came after her, including Naseem Akhtar, Shamima Dev Azad, Asha Kaul and Neerja Pandit.

Even as political unrest escalated in the 70s and 80s, Raj Begum’s regular radio broadcast, her dignified voice on the radio, was sometimes the only routine that survived. She retired in 1986.

Raj Begum’s music in the context of Kashmir’s politics

Songs of Paradise does not give any glimpse of Kashmir’s atmosphere and politics of the times it sets the story in. But music can hardly escape its context. In 1954, when Raj Begum began singing, the accession of Kashmir was still recent. Sheikh Abdullah had been imprisoned after a violent coup in 1953 and there was a lot of local unease after his deputy, Bakhshi Ghulam Mohommad, took over.

Raj Begum was later married to Qadir Ganderbali, who retired as DIG, Kashmir Police. According to Aijaz Ashraf Wani’s What Happened to Governance in Kashmir?, Ganderbali, after Abdullah’s arrest in 1953, led a specialised police unit under Ghulam Mohommad. He writes in his book, “Ganderbali unleashed a reign of terror, especially against anti-India elements. In police custody, he used such brutal methods as were not permissible under any law. No wonder then that Qadir Ganderbali became synonymous with zulum (oppression) in Kashmir”.

Awards and death

Raj Begum was given the Jammu And Kashmir State Excellence In Folk Music in 2008, some years after she won the Padma Shri in 2002. She was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 2013, three years before she passed away in 2016 at her daughter’s house in Chanapora. She was 88.","Complete Summary
Raj Begum, often called the “Nightingale of Kashmir,” was a pioneering Kashmiri female singer whose life is being loosely depicted in the new film Songs of Paradise on Amazon Prime. Born in 1927 in Srinagar and raised in poverty within a deeply conservative society, Raj Begum broke cultural taboos to become the first woman to sing on Radio Kashmir (now All India Radio, Srinagar). Her decision to sing publicly faced immense societal opposition, shame, and even social boycott, as the performing arts were looked down upon for women and seen as an occupation for the “lower classes.”

Her talent was discovered by Ghulam Qadir Langoo, a sarangi player and one-time court musician, who persuaded her family to let her sing—on the condition her daughter’s name was used to protect her identity. Langoo also trained her in melody and diction. Despite fear and secrecy, Raj Begum and later singer Naseem Akhtar paved the way for other women in Kashmiri music. Her emotive songs, including classics like “Gulrez,” “Mashravthas janan,” and “Dil chooran hai,” became beloved across communities, helping to thaw Kashmir’s dormant cultural heritage and inspiring generations of female artists.

Despite facing criticism and opposition, Raj Begum’s popularity grew, and her dignified broadcasts provided stability during periods of intense political and social unrest in Kashmir—particularly in the 1970s and 80s. She retired in 1986.

The film Songs of Paradise, though centered on her life, does not address the political complexities of Kashmir during her era. Raj Begum’s second husband, Qadir Ganderbali, served as a senior police official allegedly known for repressive tactics following Sheikh Abdullah’s arrest in 1953.

112,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/8/29/everything-has-been-lost-kashmir-floods-landslides-kill-dozens,"Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir — Forty-year-old Ruksana wails as she looks at her home, a desolate one-storey structure stripped of windows and doors next to the raging Tawi river in Jammu’s rundown neighbourhood of Gujar Nagar. A coarse coating of mud drips down the outer walls of the house.

“My husband is handicapped, and I have built this home by working at people’s homes,” she wails. “I could only rescue my two children and husband. Everything else, their clothes, their books, food has been lost.”
For dozens of families, the loss is even graver. At least 40 people have died and scores have been injured as torrential rains in Indian-administered Kashmir triggered major landslides this week, with flash floods sweeping away homes and knocking down telecommunication networks and powerlines.

The majority of those killed were pilgrims travelling to the Vaishno Devi temple in Jammu’s Katra. The shrine, one of the most popular Hindu pilgrimage spots, is located about 60km from Jammu city. Devotees trek about 12–13km uphill from the base camp to reach it.

“There was chaos. Death had never seemed [so] close. Some people are still missing,” said Rakesh Kumar, 42, who had come to Katra from Madhya Pradesh, a central Indian state. “The internet and phones were dead, which created a lot of panic.”

Jammu recorded its heaviest-ever 24-hour rainfall on Tuesday – 380mm, compared with the previous record of 270.4mm in 1988 – triggering widespread devastation across the region. Some of the deceased pilgrims visiting the Vaishno Devi shrine have been identified as residents of Punjab, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh states.

‘We hope they are alive’

Mohan Das, another devotee from the state of Uttar Pradesh, said that he was looking for five friends who were missing. “We don’t know where they are. It has been 12 hours since we last saw them,” Das said.

Jammu abuts the mountains that girdle the Kashmir Valley. The latest crisis came days after a series of flash floods in the remote regions of Kishtwar and Kathua districts killed dozens in Indian-administered Kashmir.

The regional administration has set up relief camps and announced compensation for affected families. The region’s Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and the federally appointed Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha have toured the worst-hit areas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised the central government’s assistance, and the authorities said they evacuated more than 5,000 people stranded in the floods.

In Jammu, the floods surged through the city and swept away bridges on the Tawi, a major lifeline for the region. Images showed policemen in Jammu desperately trying to halt traffic approaching a damaged bridge before a side of it collapsed.

Along the steep mountainous routes that trace a winding path through the craggy hills of Jammu, roads caved in under landslides, forcing the only land route from the rest of India to the region to shut temporarily. The Indian government also mobilised a fleet of military transport aircraft to fast-track the delivery of aid and other essential supplies into the region, where air traffic was closed on Tuesday before operations resumed the following day.

‘Waters close in on Kashmir’

Bashash Mahmood, 23, a university law student, was abruptly awakened by a midnight call while sleeping at his hotel in Srinagar. On the line was his cousin, calling from Anantnag—58 kilometres away.

Floodwaters on Wednesday knocked down mobile and electricity towers and severed optical fibre cables, crippling the region’s entire telecommunications infrastructure.

So Bashash could only hear a jumble of crackling words as he tried to make sense of what his cousin was saying. He finally managed to catch an urgent SOS message: floodwaters had surged outside his home in Bijbehara, Anantnag, and his family was in danger.

He took his car and raced along empty roads in the middle of the night, past the Indian army garrison at Badambagh, and through the sprawling saffron fields of Pampore.

When he arrived at Sangam, a canyon where two major rivers in Anantnag join, he rolled down his windows, the rain pelting against his face. “I realised that water had risen dangerously close to the embankment.”

Once he reached home, Bashash got to work and carried household items such as a fridge, furniture and utensils to the second storey of their house, emptying the ground floor.

In the morning, videos went viral showing people paddling rafts through the streets, as water had submerged large parts of South Kashmir, especially Anantnag district.

In Srinagar, the region’s biggest city, panic reached a crescendo on Wednesday afternoon – reinforced by public memories of apocalyptic floods that had struck in 2014.

Back then, floodwaters from swollen rivers had breached the banks, burying large parts of the Kashmir valley. As Bashash recalls, when the waters finally receded 11 years ago, the floods had left two feet of sludge residue that locals scooped up with their bare hands before cleaning their homes to make them livable again. “Just the thought of how hard it was for us to defecate terrifies me. We would rather refuse to eat anything to get ourselves constipated because there were no toilets,” he says.

Haunted by those memories, residents across Kashmir were seen assembling sandbags and plugging gaps to prevent breaches through which the swelling river might come. If it was the Tawi in Jammu, it was the Jhelum river – also a lifeline-turned-threat – that poses the danger in Kashmir. The river crisscrosses its way through the entire length of the Kashmir valley before crossing over into Pakistan.

Echoes of 2014, pain of 2019

On Wednesday, residents rushed to relocate or move their household goods to higher storeys in their homes in a bid to avoid a repeat of 2014. The family of Nazir Wani, a 70-year-old man suffering from a chronic pulmonary disorder that requires him to continuously have oxygen connected, said they were moving to a different neighbourhood, some 14km away, at a higher altitude.

“Where would we go if the waters rise and we get stuck? Where will we get the oxygen supply from? We are not taking any chances,” said Nousheen Wani, his daughter. The family bundled the old man into a large sports car, his eyebags sagging, as he took heavy breaths. They hauled five cylinders and two oxygen concentrators and slid them between the boot space and the rear seats, before driving away.

These floods have hit Kashmir amid crippling economic woes.

Six years ago, the Indian government stripped the region’s historic special status and demoted it from a state to a federally governed region, a move that escalated tensions with archrival Pakistan. To prevent protests, India imposed a major lockdown, suspending telecommunications and jailing thousands of people. The lockdown strangled the region’s economy, with an estimated economic loss worth $1.5bn.

Echoes of those measures continue to be felt across the region even today. According to the latest Indian government statistics, youth unemployment stands at 17.4 percent, much higher than the national average of 10.2 percent.

The floods threaten to compound that crisis. Abdullah, the elected chief minister in the disputed province, drew parallels with the aftermath of the 2014 floods. Back then, too, he was in the same role, but at the time, Indian-administered Kashmir had semiautonomous status, giving Abdullah, in some ways, more power than other Indian state leaders.

In a post on X, he complained about the failure of authorities to learn from the lessons of 2014. “What flood mitigation measures were implemented since Oct (sic) 2014?” he asked, criticising those who ruled between his two tenures, including Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, a coalition partner in the provincial government between 2015 and 2018. “These are all questions that the elected government will seek answers to because the last 48 hours have been a shocking eye-opener.”

‘Decimation of local floodplains’

While extreme weather events continue to occur regularly across India, environmental experts in Kashmir say poor natural resource management and a flurry of reckless developmental projects have amplified threats.

“In the last five years, the authorities have felled up to a million trees for what they call their pasture land retrieval programmes,” explained Raja Muzaffar Bhat, a Srinagar-based activist.

In 2020, authorities in Kashmir began evicting forest-dwelling tribal communities from their homes by cutting down their orchards. Authorities accused the communities of having “encroached” on forest land. However, the “tribals” insist they have been cultivating the land for generations.

Major construction projects, including tunnels bored through mountains, also added to the dangers of ecological collapse, Bhat suggested.

He cited the example of a 61km road project that aims to skirt past traffic-congested Srinagar city and ease access between other districts of Kashmir. The road is being built on floodplains that historically have absorbed surging waters, saving Srinagar from flooding. Instead, Bhat said, it could have been built on elevated pillars.

Tonnes of soil were extracted from precious elevated tablelands called karewas for laying the foundations on which these roads have been built, and they will pass through the floodplains of Kandizal (between the districts of Srinagar and Pulwama), Muzaffar said. The floodplains had an important role as they absorbed the water surge and prevented Srinagar city from being flooded.

Kashmir’s “topographical balance that had existed naturally for hundreds of years” is being disturbed, Muzaffar said. And this week’s floods could soon become the norm.","Torrential rains in Indian-administered Kashmir have caused devastating landslides and flash floods, killing at least 40 people—many of them Vaishno Devi pilgrims—and leaving scores more injured and missing. Families like that of Ruksana, a widow who built her home by domestic work, have lost everything except their lives, as homes have been swept away or rendered uninhabitable.

Jammu recorded its highest-ever 24-hour rainfall, breaking records set in 1988, and causing widespread damage: bridges across the Tawi river were destroyed, roads collapsed, and essential infrastructure, including telecom and power lines, went down. Relief camps have been set up, over 5,000 people have been evacuated, and political leaders including Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and PM Modi have visited the region and promised support.

Many pilgrims from across northern and central India are among the dead and missing, with families desperately seeking information on their loved ones as communication networks remain crippled. The floods have revived painful memories of the catastrophic 2014 Kashmir floods, prompting widespread panic and urgent measures as residents scramble to protect households and vulnerable family members.

The crisis was made worse by years of economic distress following the abrogation of Kashmir’s autonomous status in 2019, continued unemployment, and a battered local economy. Chief Minister Abdullah has criticized officials for a lack of lasting flood mitigation since 2014 and raised concerns about state and federal government actions, such as the massive felling of trees under land retrieval and development projects—including highway and tunnel construction on vital floodplains. Environmentalists argue these interventions have dangerously destabilized the region's ecological balance, exacerbating the impact of extreme weather events.",0,0,0,1,0

Nelson Mandela’s grandson says Palestinians suffering ‘worse form of apartheid’ than Black South Africans did

Nelson Mandela’s grandson, Mandla Mandela, has said the hardship facing Palestinians under Israeli occupation exceeds even that suffered by Black South Africans during apartheid.

Speaking to the Reuters news agency on Wednesday, Mandela, 51, said “many of us that have visited the occupied territories in Palestine have only come back with one conclusion: That the Palestinians are experiencing a far worse form of apartheid than we ever experienced.

“We believe that the global community has to continue supporting the Palestinians, just as they stood side by side with us,” he added.

Mandela gave the comments as he prepared to board a flight to Tunisia to join the Global Sumud Flotilla, aimed to deliver food and humanitarian supplies to Gaza.

He is among 10 South African activists travelling with the flotilla, which includes dozens of boats and hundreds of people from 44 countries, including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.

South Africa’s African National Congress said the flotilla’s mission “echoes our own struggle for liberation”.

Projectile lands near vessel in Bab al-Mandeb Strait: Report

The UK Maritime Trade Operations Centre (UKMTO) has sent an alert over “suspicious activity” in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, some 178 nautical miles (330km) northwest of Yemen’s Hodeidah.

In an alert published on its website, the UKMTO says a vessel travelling in the strait, The Master, reported that an “unknown projectile” landed in the sea “some distance from the vessel”.

The report said the vessel and crew are safe but cautioned other ships to “transit with caution”.

Yemen’s Houthi rebels have previously waged attacks on vessels passing through the strait that they claim are linked to Israel.

Israel will only respond to ‘sticks’, not ‘carrots’, in ceasefire talks: Analyst

Israel never had “the intention to reach this ceasefire agreement, because they have other plans”, Luciano Zaccara, a Middle East political analyst, has told Al Jazeera.

He said Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s comments on Wednesday “made it very clear that the intention of Israel is to annex more territories, including [the occupied] West Bank and Gaza“.

“So what is the point in allowing the creation of an entity, either with Hamas or without … that can represent Palestinians when the plan is already set that these territories will belong to Israel sooner or later?” he asked.

“There is no way that Israel would agree to something with Hamas allowing them to survive politically, and allowing the Palestinian entity to be created,” he added.

He said that despite the best efforts of mediators, “[for Israel] there are no more carrots in this conversation, it is only sticks.

“Because the [Israeli] objective is not to negotiate anything, not to give priority to the release of the hostages … but to vacate the whole Gaza Strip in order to implement what they wanted to do, which is [to seize it as] Israeli territory”.

‘They erased them all’: Families being decimated in Gaza City

Three-year-old Ibrahim was the sole survivor of an Israeli attack that ripped through a Gaza City apartment and killed his parents and siblings.

There’s grief and relief for his grandmother, Umm Abu al-Abed Abu al-Jubein.

“This column and all the rubble were lying on top of him; I don’t know how, but God saved him,” she said.

“He is the only one. His mother, father and two siblings were lost. We woke up to the boy screaming … We found my daughter in pieces; her husband and daughters were scattered around her.”

Ibrahim is now one of the more than 49,000 children in Gaza who have lost one or both parents, according to health authorities.

UNICEF estimates that at least 17,000 children have been orphaned since Israel’s war on Gaza began.

Entire families are being killed together in their tents and shelters as the Israeli bombardment of Gaza City intensifies.

“My brother was killed, struck inside his room,” displaced Palestinian Sabreen al-Mabhuh said.

“They killed him with his wife and children; they erased them all. No one is left.”

Gaza City hospitals facing ‘huge pressure’ as casualties mount

By Tareq Abu Azzoum

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, central Gaza

Doctors say they are dealing with a huge influx of casualties that continue to arrive at hospitals.

There is huge pressure on medical teams operating in front-line hospitals in Gaza City, such as al-Ahli Arab Hospital and al-Shifa Hospital. Doctors there report a nonstop surge of air attacks and a large number of people who need life-saving treatment.

In the hospital we’re standing in front of in Deir el-Balah, there are not even enough stretchers to carry people, so volunteers often have to carry people in on their backs or shoulders.

This shows the growing state of emergency and how civilians on the ground are bearing the brunt of Israel’s deadly military campaign.

Palestinians continue to flee northern Gaza; south faces more overcrowding, inflation

Palestinians who have fled Gaza City over the past few months have found dire conditions elsewhere in Gaza.

Their arrival has further overcrowded tent camps and pushed prices of basic goods much higher.

“The beach is crowded. Everywhere is crowded. There’s no hygiene. It’s a struggle to get water and food,” Iman el-Naya, from Khan Younis, who fled Gaza City three months ago, told the AP.

“I go and stand in line for water. Getting bread is a struggle. Everything is even more expensive after the people from the north came here,” she said.

Shorouk Abu Eid, a pregnant woman from Gaza City, who was displaced to Khan Younis four months ago, said the arrival of more people from the north is creating an even more tragic situation.

“There is no privacy, no peace of mind,” she told AP.

“Places I used to walk to in five or 10 minutes are taking me around an hour now because of the congestion. There’s barely 10cm [4 inches] between tents,” Abu Eid added.

Family ‘wiped out’ in Nuseirat attack amid ‘very bloody night’ in Gaza

By Tareq Abu Azzoum

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, central Gaza

It was a very bloody night for families in Gaza City. There was a deadly series of air strikes and heavy artillery bombardment in the eastern part of the city.

We understand that a number of makeshift tents were hit, killing at least four Palestinians and wounding 15 others who are now receiving emergency treatment in al-Shifa Hospital.

In central Gaza, there was a surge in air strikes on makeshift tents. In the Nuseirat refugee camp, an entire family of seven, including a young girl, was wiped out overnight in one of the deadliest air strikes recorded in the past 12 hours.

The al-Mawasi area of southern Gaza, where people have recently been told to go, has also been under heavy attack.

A makeshift tent was struck with three missiles, killing and wounding several people.

UNRWA unable to bring aid into Gaza for 6 months

UNRWA has renewed its call on Israel to lift restrictions on its Gaza aid operations, saying it has been unable to bring in supplies for six months.

“Families in Gaza have been left without essentials. UNRWA has not been allowed to bring in any aid for six months now,” said the agency in a post on X.

“Shelter items like mattresses, blankets and tents are much needed. UNRWA is ready to deliver – the siege must be lifted,” it added.

An Israeli law banning UNRWA from working on Israeli soil or with Israeli authorities came into effect in January, severely affecting the organisation’s life-saving work in Gaza.

Israel has since largely handed over aid distribution in Gaza to the US-backed GHF, whose distribution sites have repeatedly been marred by deadly shootings of aid seekers.

Only one in four detainees from Gaza in Israeli jails are fighters: Report

A report in the British newspaper The Guardian, citing classified data, says only one in four detainees from Gaza are identified as fighters by Israel’s military intelligence, and civilians make up the “vast majority of Palestinians held without charge or trial in abusive prisons”.

It said those serving long sentences in Israeli jails include medical workers, teachers, civil servants, media workers, writers, sick and disabled people and children.

The newspaper said an 82-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s was jailed by Israeli authorities for six weeks, while a single mother was separated from her young children, and when she was released after 53 days, she found the children begging on the streets.

Israel’s infamous Sde Teiman military base, which doubles as a prison for Palestinians, “at one point held so many sick, disabled and elderly Palestinians that they had their own hangar, dubbed ‘the geriatric pen’,” a soldier serving there said.

Israeli military representative doubts Gaza City offensive will defeat Hamas

An Israeli military representative told a Knesset committee that the seizure of Gaza City would not necessarily break Hamas’s hold on the enclave, according to public broadcaster Kan.

During a closed session of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, the representative was asked why occupying Gaza City would compel Hamas “to budge at all”.

“I did not say it would move Hamas, it is not certain at all,” the representative replied, according to Kan. “The city has symbolic significance.”

As we’ve been reporting, Israeli forces are continuing to ramp up attacks in and around Gaza City as they gear up for a full-on invasion. Overnight and into the early morning, Israeli attacks there killed at least nine Palestinians, including four children, according to local hospital sources.

US ‘very troubled’ by Norway’s divestment from Caterpillar over Israeli abuses

President Trump’s administration has said it’s “very troubled” by the Norway’s wealth fund’s decision to divest from US construction equipment group Caterpillar on ethical grounds related to Israel’s war on Gaza.

“We are very troubled by the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund’s decision, which appears to be based on illegitimate claims against Caterpillar and the Israeli government,” a US State Department spokesperson said, according to the Reuters news agency.

“We are engaging directly with the Norwegian government on this matter,” the official added.

In late August, Norway’s $2 trillion wealth fund, the world’s largest, announced it had divested from five Israeli banking groups, as well as Caterpillar Inc, on ethical grounds.

The five banks were excluded “due to an unacceptable risk that the companies contribute to serious violations of the rights of individuals in situations of war and conflict”, the fund said in a statement.

It also said Caterpillar’s products, such as bulldozers, were being used by Israeli authorities “to commit extensive and systematic violations of international humanitarian law” such as the “widespread unlawful destruction of Palestinian property”.

My house ‘keeps dancing, going right and left like an earthquake’

With Israeli bulldozers razing buildings in Gaza City and Israeli leaders supporting the forced mass displacement of Palestinians, departing the city now could mean leaving for good.

“The Israeli forces, when they mark any area by red colour and they request the people to leave, they really will destroy it,” Mohammed al-Kurdi, who is sheltering in Gaza City along with hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, told The Associated Press.

“So it’s like you decide whether to live or die. It’s very simple like that.”

Al-Kurdi, a project manager and consultant, said he can hear Israeli forces from the apartment where he’s sheltering as they “erase the area completely”.

“It’s not something partial like before. It’s 100 percent,” he said. “The house, I’m telling my friends, it keeps dancing all day. It keeps dancing, going right and left like an earthquake.”

Amal Seyam, the general director of the Women’s Affairs Centre in Gaza, has been displaced five times since the war began.

“Many people have started packing. Many have already left,” she told the AP.

“Do you know what displacement means? It means moving once again, building your life once again, buying new things, blankets, tents, all over again.”

Judge says Trump admin used anti-Semitism as ‘smokescreen’ for Harvard cuts

A United States federal judge has ruled that the administration of President Donald Trump violated the law when it cancelled research grants worth more than $2.2bn to Harvard University.

The decision from District Judge Allison Burroughs on Wednesday is a major setback for the Trump administration, which has sought to pressure universities into compliance with policies opposing pro-Palestine protests and diversity initiatives.

In her ruling, Burroughs wrote that “a review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used anti-Semitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically motivated assault on this country’s premier universities.”

Trump has targeted several schools, including Columbia, for their prominent role in the antiwar protests that emerged after Israel launched its war on Gaza in October 2023.

The Trump administration argued that those protests promoted anti-Semitism and created an unsafe environment for Jewish students. Student activists, however, have rejected those assertions.

A recap of recent developments

Here’s what you need to know:

    At least 73 Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza on Wednesday, including at least 43 people in Gaza City alone, hospital sources told Al Jazeera.
    Hamas said it has agreed to the formation of an independent national administration to run Gaza, and it is ready for a comprehensive truce deal which would see all Israeli captives released.
    Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office rejected Hamas’s statement saying “the war can end immediately” on the conditions set by Israel’s cabinet, including the release of all Israeli captives and the Palestinian group’s disarmament.
    The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon said Israeli drones dropped four grenades close to peacekeepers on Tuesday morning, calling it one of “the most serious attacks” on its forces since the cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in November.
    Israel’s army said it identified the launch of a missile from Yemen in the early hours of Thursday morning – the third in less than 24 hours – and it was working to intercept the threat.
","The humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to intensify as Israeli bombardment targets residential areas and makeshift shelters across Gaza City, resulting in at least 28 Palestinian deaths since dawn on Thursday. Entire families are being killed in airstrikes—stories include a three-year-old who survived while his family was wiped out, and a tent full of displaced people killed in recent attacks. Hospitals are overwhelmed, lacking enough stretchers and facing an unceasing stream of casualties.

The UN’s relief agency (UNRWA) reports being unable to deliver aid into Gaza for six months due to a tight Israeli blockade, leaving families without essentials. Blockade-induced shortages have also forced many Palestinians to attempt to generate fuel by burning plastic waste, polluting the environment and putting public health at further risk.

The toll on children is catastrophic: over 49,000 children have lost one or both parents and at least 17,000 are orphaned, according to UNICEF and local health authorities. In Gaza’s south, tent camps are overcrowded, with high prices and severe shortages of water, food, and basic supplies.

Internationally, South African activist Mandla Mandela, grandson of Nelson Mandela, likened the Palestinian experience to “a far worse form of apartheid” than Black South Africans suffered, and joined a flotilla heading to deliver aid to Gaza. Norway’s sovereign fund has divested from US-based Caterpillar Inc and Israeli banks over ethical concerns related to Gaza operations. Meanwhile, US officials are pressuring Norway in response to these moves.

In the West Bank, Israeli forces intensified raids and arrests. Regionally, tensions also rose with projectiles landing in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait and continued Houthi missile launches toward Israel.

Analysts suggest Israel will not pursue a ceasefire with Hamas, aiming instead to clear and annex territory. Israeli officials admitted that seizing Gaza City may not defeat Hamas. Ongoing protests within Israel are calling for an end to the war and safe return of Israeli captives.

Hamas, meanwhile, states its willingness for a comprehensive truce deal and to form an independent Gaza administration in exchange for the release of all Israeli captives. Israel’s government maintains its condition for any end to the war: the release of all hostages and the effective disarmament of Hamas.",1,1,0,1,0

German activist denounces her country’s role in Gaza genocide

As part of the Global Sumud Flotilla, German lawyer Melanie Schweizer spoke in Tunisia’s capital on Wednesday night about the complicity of the German government in what she described as the genocide in Gaza.

Schweizer said Germany had pledged to never commit or support genocide after the Holocaust, but that it is again “on the side taking part in genocide”. She added that the Global South is leading the charge to stop Israel’s mass killing of Palestinians in Gaza, even as human rights activists are arrested and face charges for similar protests in Western states.

“An event like this would not be possible in Germany, and that’s because of state repression,” she said.

“We are here to set the record straight … to say that our governments do not represent us and that our governments have failed,” Schweizer added.

Palestinians continue to go hungry in Gaza

By Hani Mahmoud

Reporting from Gaza City

It’s misleading now to see some of the headlines talking about products and items being allowed into the Gaza Strip.

A brief walk on the streets shows there is a complete absence of protein sources, an absence of fresh produce. It took us half a day, just a couple of days ago, to find 1kg (2.2lb) of tomatoes, and what we found was very old, not fresh, and very, very expensive.

A pick-up truck filled with Nutella jars – this is not addressing the spread of famine.

On the ground, we’re seeing more people going hungry. People are still rationing supplies. Families and mothers are eating one meal a day to provide for their children.

And inside the hospitals, the number of people suffering from acute malnutrition because of the enforced starvation is on the rise.

Activists take part in training in Tunis before joining flotilla

Dozens of activists have attended a training day in the Tunisian capital, Tunis, before their expected departure from the North African country on Sunday.

The comedian and activist Kat Nip posted a video of the event, featuring attendees chanting “Free Gaza.”

Also in attendance was Al Jazeera correspondent Fahmida Miller, who is covering the flotilla.

Nip’s video featured various activists explaining why they had chosen to take part in the Global Sumud Flotilla.

“We all know about the atrocities, the genocide. Enough is enough,” said Riyaz Mulla from South Africa. “No government is going to help. It’s up to our super-family of humanity to take the steps and try to break the siege in Gaza.”

Italian politicians to join flotilla

The four Italian parliamentarians who will join the Global Sumud Flotilla are Benedetta Scuderi, a member of the European Parliament for the Green Europe party; Annalisa Corrado, a member of the European Parliament and the Democratic Party; Arturo Scotto, an Italian MP also in the Democratic Party; and Senator Marco Croatti of the Five Star Movement.

That is according to Maria Elena Delia, a spokesperson for the Italian delegation of the Global Movement to Gaza who was quoted by the Italian news channel Sky TG24.

“They have decided to lay down their bodies,” Delia said. “You can imagine how important this is.”

Delia said five boats had already departed from Liguria in northern Italy and more would depart on Sunday.

Elly Schlein, the leader of the Democratic Party, the biggest opposition party in the Italian Parliament, said the flotilla has its “full support”.

Global Sumud Flotilla urges European protection after Israel’s threats against Gaza aid mission

By Al Jazeera Staff

The Global Sumud Flotilla has called on European states to protect it following what organisers described on social media as threats from Israel.

Sailing from Barcelona on its way to Gaza last night, the flotilla encountered a number of unidentified drones that remained hovering over the vessels for some time.

Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has also threatened to treat the flotilla’s volunteers as “terrorists” should they continue their journey to deliver food and medicine to the besieged enclave.

Ben-Gvir was previously convicted in Israel of incitement to racism, destroying property, possessing a “terror” organisation’s propaganda material and supporting a “terror” organisation.

Spain calls European response to Gaza a ‘failure’ as Israel kills at least 44 Palestinians

Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said earlier on Wednesday that the European response to Israel’s war on Gaza was a “failure”.

“It is a failure,” Sanchez said. “Absolutely. It is also the reality that, within the EU, there are countries that are divided when it comes to how to influence Israel.

“In my opinion, it’s not acceptable and we can’t last longer if we want to increase our credibility when it comes to other crises, such as the one we face in Ukraine.”

It’s been yet another deadly day in Gaza where at least 44 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, including aid seekers, since dawn on Wednesday.

Israeli navy carried out maritime training two days ago

The Israeli army said Wednesday that its navy division conducted maritime drills two days ago, just hours before the Global Sumud Flotilla started its journey from Barcelona.

According to The Times of Israel, the navy troops practised a “variety of combat scenarios”.

The Global Sumud Flotilla has repeatedly said it poses no threat to Israel and is merely trying to open a humanitarian corridor into Gaza, where some two million Palestinians are starving under an Israeli siege.

The activists are sailing through international waters, which means that Israel does not have legal jurisdiction to intercept their boats.

However, Israel has still intercepted previous vessels trying to reach Gaza as part of its maritime blockade of the Strip. The most recent, the Handala, was intercepted by Israeli forces about 160 nautical miles (184 miles) off Gaza’s coast in June.

Children from across Tunisia are writing letters to the children of Gaza to be carried by the Tunisian boats that will join the Flotilla when it docks.

In one of the donation centres in the capital Tunis, 15-year-old Hedi and her mother were dropping off their donations.,

“Can I please join you in my free time?” she was overheard asking one of the volunteers at the centre.

“I can do anything. I just need to attend my maths session in the mornings, but I’m free for the rest of the day.”

Dozens of other children have shown up at the centre with their animation-themed money boxes and small, personalised gifts.

In Hedi’s letter, the message was simple: “May God protect you and bring you victory. I love you so much.”

Life at sea: Training intensifies for volunteers facing challenges and intercept risks

The volunteers’ focus only appears to have increased since last night’s encounter with the drones, writes Mauricio Morales from on board the flotilla.

On board, daily routines are beginning to take shape.

People wake up, and preparations and training sessions are promised for after breakfast.

Under the hot sun and with calmer seas, fire and ship-abandonment drills are carried out.

For some volunteers, it’s their first time putting on lifejackets and facing the practical challenges of life at sea.

Food rationing meetings follow. “Remember, there is starvation in Gaza,” one volunteer reminds the group, setting not only the tone of the mission but also establishing a kind of moral compass for the 24 people from different nationalities and backgrounds who find themselves working together on board this vessel.

Then comes the crucial training: how to respond to a possible interception in international waters by the Israeli army and the boarding of the ship.

The volunteers recall their sessions on non-violence back in Barcelona – never engaging with Israeli soldiers, never touching them in any way, and always keeping their hands visible.

Any break from the non-violent nature of the mission could cost someone their life.

“It’s a strange thing to have to do, but anything is worth it for the solidarity with Palestine,” Isla, a 24-year-old Australian volunteer, whose mother and sister are on board boats within the flotilla, comments.

More training is scheduled for the afternoon and will continue late into the night.

Everyone expects the drones to return.

Famine declared in Gaza in August

The UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) determined that there was famine in Gaza City and other areas of northern Gaza in August, warning that it would spread to other parts of the Palestinian enclave by September if Israel’s war did not end.

The famine has given added urgency to the Global Sumud Flotilla’s mission to break the siege of Gaza.

The IPC said that the famine in Gaza is caused by four man-made factors: conflict, displacement, restricted access, and food system collapse.

Israel imposed a total blockade on the entry of food and other supplies into Gaza in mid-March, just before it unilaterally broke a ceasefire that had held since January. Severe restrictions on imports to Gaza remain in place, and Israel’s insistence that it will continue fighting has contributed to the spread of the famine.

Greta Thunberg: Celebrated climate activist who has used her clout to support Gaza

The 22-year-old Swedish climate icon is perhaps the most famous name on the Sumud Flotilla, having risen to prominence in 2018 when she began a school strike movement in her home country to demand action to stop climate change.

Thunberg quickly gained prominence, addressing the United Nations and being named the youngest ever “Person of the Year” by Time magazine in 2019.

But elite circles have not been as vocal in their backing of Thunberg since she started voicing her support for Palestinians following the start of Israel’s war on Gaza, and she has faced criticism from some on the pro-Israeli side.

Thunberg has, however, doubled down on her pro-Palestinian activism, and joined a flotilla seeking to break Israel’s siege of Gaza in June. The Madleen ship she was travelling on was eventually violently intercepted by Israeli forces, and Thunberg, along with the others on board, was briefly detained by Israel before being deported.

That has not stopped Thunberg from participating in the latest – and much bigger – flotilla as one of its organisers.

Politicians back Global Sumud Flotilla mission

Numerous leaders, public figures and international organisations have expressed their support for the Global Sumud Flotilla and its mission to break Gaza’s siege.

Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro wrote to the activists onboard the flotilla expressing his solidarity and support for their mission.

 

In Italy, former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, the head of the country’s Five Star Movement, described the Global Sumud Flotilla as an “extraordinary reaction from ‘below’ to international indifference” on the topic.

As well as Barcelona’s former mayor, Ada Colau, who is on board the flotilla, a number of Spanish politicians have expressed their support. Jaume Asens, a Spanish member of the European Parliament, has written in support of the flotilla, while Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said his government will “deploy all of its diplomatic and consular protection to protect our citizens” sailing towards Gaza.

“Many have seen for yourselves that a million people in Gaza are being starved to death,” he said. “We are proud comrades to say that we have over 40 boats that we have been able to mobilise with 44 countries that have come together.”

“We call on all states and relevant authorities to take every possible measure to guarantee, at a minimum, the opening of a safe and continuous humanitarian corridor to Gaza,” the signatories said.

“This is a moral, legal, and humanitarian imperative,” they added. “Civilians must have access to life-saving aid without obstruction or delay.”

The elected representatives on board the flotilla included politicians from Argentina, Brazil, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.

More than 160 other elected representatives also signed the statement in support of those on board.

Israel’s Ben-Gvir wants to designate flotilla volunteers as ‘terrorists’

Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir says he wants to designate all the Sumud Global Flotilla volunteers as “terrorists” and arrest them.

Ben-Gvir presented the plan at a discussion on Sunday to discuss measures to stop the flotilla from reaching the two million or so people trapped and starving in Gaza.

Attending the meeting were Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defence Minister Israel Katz, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer.

Under Ben-Gvir’s suggestion, any volunteers taken while trying to bring food and aid into Gaza will be held in Israel’s Ketziot and Damon prisons, which are used to hold “terrorists” under stringent conditions typically reserved for security prisoners.

“We will not allow individuals who support terrorism to live in comfort. They will face the full consequences of their actions,” Ben-Gvir, who was convicted of inciting terrorism in 2007, said.

Images: Global Sumud Flotilla leaving Barcelona

By Al Jazeera Staff

After delays due to weather, vessels taking part in the Global Sumud Flotilla set sail from Barcelona on Monday.

On board the vessels, along with Greta Thunberg, humanitarian activist Thiago Avila and roughly 350 other activists, is journalist and photographer Mauricio Morales, who will be reporting for Al Jazeera from one of the ships, the Alma.

Activists from 44 countries, including journalists, politicians, environmentalists, doctors and humanitarians had either used the extra time granted by the delay to either rest on board, or source additional supplies for Gaza, Morales said.

“Morale remained high, but uncertainty lingered about the exact departure time and whether a shifting political situation might delay or even block the flotilla’s exit from Barcelona,” Morales wrote from on board the Alma. “Sabotage was considered a real risk, and organisers were cautious about sharing sensitive information, wary of individuals seen filming the boats and crews.”

“I expect this flotilla under the international rules to be allowed to go to Gaza. That’s our plan. We stand with the people of Palestine and we will not be stopped.”

Drones spotted above Sumud Flotilla

By Mauricio Morales

Reporting from on board the Alma, off the Mediterranean coast of Spain

The rough weather that plagued the start of the Sumud Flotilla’s journey lingered into Tuesday morning, leaving some of the 24 volunteers on the Alma seasick. Exhausted, some volunteers found whatever corner they could to rest, even on the floor of the vessel, which was never designed to carry so many passengers.

The organisers of the flotilla assessed the damage after the storm, and instructed the vessels to regroup on a new course. Some boats had sustained damage, but have still been able to sail.

Daily life at sea quickly mixed political talks with chores: cleaning toilets, cooking, securing cargo, checking medical supplies, and rotating through security guard duty while discussing the political motives or the question that begins to resonate: “Why are you here?”

When the dark of the night began to settle to mark the end of the day, the Alma alarm blared, and everybody scrambled to the deck and put on their life jackets.

Two drones were hovering above the vessel, and communications from other boats reported the drones, as well. With the boat’s lights turned off, the flickering lights of the drones could be seen hovering over the vessel, before they eventually left, leaving those on the Alma silent, and wary.

On board the Familia setting off from Barcelona is Ada Colau Ballano, an activist and the former mayor of the city of Barcelona from 2015 to 2023. She is the first woman to have held the position of Barcelona’s mayor.

Colau Ballano previously took part in a 2014 flotilla from Istanbul that Israel intercepted.

“What’s wonderful is that this time, from my own city, Barcelona, the biggest attempt of all is setting out with 20 boats, and it’s going to be very difficult for [Israel] to stop us from reaching Gaza,” she told Al Jazeera.

Colau Ballano was seen hugging her children and saying goodbye before setting sail.

“My children and I have always spoken very openly about how the world is, and we’ve talked about what’s happening in Gaza and in Palestine, and it’s something that is part of our daily life at home, so they’re very aware,” she said.

“My little one started to cry when he saw I was really getting on the boat, but he perfectly understands the reasons,” Colau Ballano said.

“He knows that thousands of boys and girls are being killed and that today it’s for them, tomorrow it will be for others, but we can’t allow it and so my children encouraged me to get on the flotilla, even though they may worry about me a little, but they encouraged me to go because they know what’s at stake and they totally support the cause.”

What happened to past Freedom Flotillas?

Several Freedom Flotilla vessels have attempted to break the blockade of Gaza.

Two boats from the Free Gaza Movement successfully reached Gaza in 2008. It was the first breach of Israel’s naval blockade.

The movement, founded in 2006 by activists during Israel’s war on Lebanon, went on to launch 31 boats between 2008 and 2016, five of which reached Gaza despite heavy Israeli restrictions.

But since 2010, all flotillas attempting to break the Gaza blockade have been illegally intercepted or attacked by Israel in international waters.

In 2010, Israeli commandos raided the Mavi Marmara in international waters, killing 10 activists and injuring dozens, leading to global outrage.

The ship was carrying humanitarian aid and more than 600 passengers.

In July 2025, the Handala was intercepted in the Mediterranean Sea.

Genoa port workers threaten lockdown if Israel harasses Flotilla

On Saturday, port workers from Genoa, Italy, issued a stark challenge to Israeli authorities should they attempt to intercept the flotilla, as they have previous ones.

“Around mid-September, these boats will arrive near the coast of Gaza. If we lose contact with our boats, with our comrades, even for just 20 minutes, we will shut down all of Europe,” an unidentified dockworker from the Unione Sindacale di Base Confederazione Nazionale (USB) told crowds over the weekend in a widely circulated video.

“From this region 13 to 14,000 containers leave every year for Israel, not a single nail will leave anymore,” he added.

Everything you need to know about the Flotilla

The Global Sumud Flotilla for Gaza has set out towards Gaza after a false start on Sunday.

Hundreds of people are on board about 15 vessels, including journalists, doctors, politicians, humanitarians and activists from 44 countries.

The flotilla’s planned first stop is Tunisia, where they will link up with other ships.

They will be joined by more boats from Italy and other undisclosed ports in an effort to break Israel’s illegal siege on Gaza, which is starving Palestinians to death as Israel’s war on Gaza continues.

The volunteers hope to transport much-needed food and medicine to besieged Palestinians and to open a humanitarian corridor, allowing more civilian vessels to follow.

This is the largest effort to break Israel’s siege on Gaza and follows previous attempts dating back to 2010. Israel intercepted and sometimes attacked past flotillas.

Everything you need to know about the flotilla is explained here.

‘It’s not about us, it’s about Gaza’

Before departing from Barcelona on Sunday, hundreds of volunteers on the Sumud Flotilla stressed that the “news story” is not them, but the hundreds of thousands of people dying from Israel’s genocide in Gaza.

“We are not heroes. We are not the story. The story is about the people of Gaza,” said Thiago Avila, a lifelong activist for Palestine and an organiser for the flotilla.

Many others on board the Flotilla echoed that sentiment and stressed that they were compelled to join the flotilla due to the distressing and horrific images of Palestinian children being relentlessly killed and starved to death.

“I love my daughter so much, as the mothers and fathers in Gaza [love their children], and because of this love. We cannot leave a world like this,” said Avila.

“We have to change the society that enables a genocide to happen,” he told Al Jazeera.

Sumud Flotilla perseveres, departs Barcelona despite bad weather

By Al Jazeera Staff

The Global Sumud Flotilla has departed Barcelona on Monday evening after having had to return to port on Sunday due to bad weather.

Conditions are still far from ideal, with six of the smaller vessels already having had to return to port for repairs.

However, dozens of vessels remain, each carrying desperately needed aid for the blockaded Gaza Strip along with about 350 activists.

German activist denounces her country’s role in Gaza genocide

As part of the Global Sumud Flotilla, German lawyer Melanie Schweizer spoke in Tunisia’s capital on Wednesday night about the complicity of the German government in what she described as the genocide in Gaza.

Schweizer said Germany had pledged to never commit or support genocide after the Holocaust, but that it is again “on the side taking part in genocide”. She added that the Global South is leading the charge to stop Israel’s mass killing of Palestinians in Gaza, even as human rights activists are arrested and face charges for similar protests in Western states.

“An event like this would not be possible in Germany, and that’s because of state repression,” she said.

“We are here to set the record straight … to say that our governments do not represent us and that our governments have failed,” Schweizer added.

Palestinians continue to go hungry in Gaza

By Hani Mahmoud

Reporting from Gaza City

It’s misleading now to see some of the headlines talking about products and items being allowed into the Gaza Strip.

A brief walk on the streets shows there is a complete absence of protein sources, an absence of fresh produce. It took us half a day, just a couple of days ago, to find 1kg (2.2lb) of tomatoes, and what we found was very old, not fresh, and very, very expensive.

A pick-up truck filled with Nutella jars – this is not addressing the spread of famine.

On the ground, we’re seeing more people going hungry. People are still rationing supplies. Families and mothers are eating one meal a day to provide for their children.

And inside the hospitals, the number of people suffering from acute malnutrition because of the enforced starvation is on the rise.

Also in attendance was Al Jazeera correspondent Fahmida Miller, who is covering the flotilla.

Nip’s video featured various activists explaining why they had chosen to take part in the Global Sumud Flotilla.

Italian politicians to join flotilla

The four Italian parliamentarians who will join the Global Sumud Flotilla are Benedetta Scuderi, a member of the European Parliament for the Green Europe party; Annalisa Corrado, a member of the European Parliament and the Democratic Party; Arturo Scotto, an Italian MP also in the Democratic Party; and Senator Marco Croatti of the Five Star Movement.

That is according to Maria Elena Delia, a spokesperson for the Italian delegation of the Global Movement to Gaza who was quoted by the Italian news channel Sky TG24.

“They have decided to lay down their bodies,” Delia said. “You can imagine how important this is.”

Delia said five boats had already departed from Liguria in northern Italy and more would depart on Sunday.

Elly Schlein, the leader of the Democratic Party, the biggest opposition party in the Italian Parliament, said the flotilla has its “full support”.

Global Sumud Flotilla urges European protection after Israel’s threats against Gaza aid mission

By Al Jazeera Staff

The Global Sumud Flotilla has called on European states to protect it following what organisers described on social media as threats from Israel.

Sailing from Barcelona on its way to Gaza last night, the flotilla encountered a number of unidentified drones that remained hovering over the vessels for some time.

Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has also threatened to treat the flotilla’s volunteers as “terrorists” should they continue their journey to deliver food and medicine to the besieged enclave.

Ben-Gvir was previously convicted in Israel of incitement to racism, destroying property, possessing a “terror” organisation’s propaganda material and supporting a “terror” organisation.

Spain calls European response to Gaza a ‘failure’ as Israel kills at least 44 Palestinians

Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said earlier on Wednesday that the European response to Israel’s war on Gaza was a “failure”.

“It is a failure,” Sanchez said. “Absolutely. It is also the reality that, within the EU, there are countries that are divided when it comes to how to influence Israel.

“In my opinion, it’s not acceptable and we can’t last longer if we want to increase our credibility when it comes to other crises, such as the one we face in Ukraine.”

It’s been yet another deadly day in Gaza where at least 44 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, including aid seekers, since dawn on Wednesday.

Israeli navy carried out maritime training two days ago

The Israeli army said Wednesday that its navy division conducted maritime drills two days ago, just hours before the Global Sumud Flotilla started its journey from Barcelona.

According to The Times of Israel, the navy troops practised a “variety of combat scenarios”.

The Global Sumud Flotilla has repeatedly said it poses no threat to Israel and is merely trying to open a humanitarian corridor into Gaza, where some two million Palestinians are starving under an Israeli siege.

The activists are sailing through international waters, which means that Israel does not have legal jurisdiction to intercept their boats.

However, Israel has still intercepted previous vessels trying to reach Gaza as part of its maritime blockade of the Strip. The most recent, the Handala, was intercepted by Israeli forces about 160 nautical miles (184 miles) off Gaza’s coast in June.

Children from across Tunisia are writing letters to the children of Gaza to be carried by the Tunisian boats that will join the Flotilla when it docks.

In one of the donation centres in the capital Tunis, 15-year-old Hedi and her mother were dropping off their donations.,

“Can I please join you in my free time?” she was overheard asking one of the volunteers at the centre.

“I can do anything. I just need to attend my maths session in the mornings, but I’m free for the rest of the day.”

Dozens of other children have shown up at the centre with their animation-themed money boxes and small, personalised gifts.

In Hedi’s letter, the message was simple: “May God protect you and bring you victory. I love you so much.”

Life at sea: Training intensifies for volunteers facing challenges and intercept risks

The volunteers’ focus only appears to have increased since last night’s encounter with the drones, writes Mauricio Morales from on board the flotilla.

On board, daily routines are beginning to take shape.

People wake up, and preparations and training sessions are promised for after breakfast.

Under the hot sun and with calmer seas, fire and ship-abandonment drills are carried out.

For some volunteers, it’s their first time putting on lifejackets and facing the practical challenges of life at sea.

Food rationing meetings follow. “Remember, there is starvation in Gaza,” one volunteer reminds the group, setting not only the tone of the mission but also establishing a kind of moral compass for the 24 people from different nationalities and backgrounds who find themselves working together on board this vessel.

Then comes the crucial training: how to respond to a possible interception in international waters by the Israeli army and the boarding of the ship.

The volunteers recall their sessions on non-violence back in Barcelona – never engaging with Israeli soldiers, never touching them in any way, and always keeping their hands visible.

Any break from the non-violent nature of the mission could cost someone their life.

“It’s a strange thing to have to do, but anything is worth it for the solidarity with Palestine,” Isla, a 24-year-old Australian volunteer, whose mother and sister are on board boats within the flotilla, comments.

More training is scheduled for the afternoon and will continue late into the night.

Everyone expects the drones to return.

Famine declared in Gaza in August

The UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) determined that there was famine in Gaza City and other areas of northern Gaza in August, warning that it would spread to other parts of the Palestinian enclave by September if Israel’s war did not end.

The famine has given added urgency to the Global Sumud Flotilla’s mission to break the siege of Gaza.

The IPC said that the famine in Gaza is caused by four man-made factors: conflict, displacement, restricted access, and food system collapse.

Israel imposed a total blockade on the entry of food and other supplies into Gaza in mid-March, just before it unilaterally broke a ceasefire that had held since January. Severe restrictions on imports to Gaza remain in place, and Israel’s insistence that it will continue fighting has contributed to the spread of the famine.

Greta Thunberg: Celebrated climate activist who has used her clout to support Gaza

The 22-year-old Swedish climate icon is perhaps the most famous name on the Sumud Flotilla, having risen to prominence in 2018 when she began a school strike movement in her home country to demand action to stop climate change.

Thunberg quickly gained prominence, addressing the United Nations and being named the youngest ever “Person of the Year” by Time magazine in 2019.

But elite circles have not been as vocal in their backing of Thunberg since she started voicing her support for Palestinians following the start of Israel’s war on Gaza, and she has faced criticism from some on the pro-Israeli side.

Thunberg has, however, doubled down on her pro-Palestinian activism, and joined a flotilla seeking to break Israel’s siege of Gaza in June. The Madleen ship she was travelling on was eventually violently intercepted by Israeli forces, and Thunberg, along with the others on board, was briefly detained by Israel before being deported.

That has not stopped Thunberg from participating in the latest – and much bigger – flotilla as one of its organisers.

Numerous leaders, public figures and international organisations have expressed their support for the Global Sumud Flotilla and its mission to break Gaza’s siege.

Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro wrote to the activists onboard the flotilla expressing his solidarity and support for their mission.

 

In Italy, former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, the head of the country’s Five Star Movement, described the Global Sumud Flotilla as an “extraordinary reaction from ‘below’ to international indifference” on the topic.

As well as Barcelona’s former mayor, Ada Colau, who is on board the flotilla, a number of Spanish politicians have expressed their support. Jaume Asens, a Spanish member of the European Parliament, has written in support of the flotilla, while Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said his government will “deploy all of its diplomatic and consular protection to protect our citizens” sailing towards Gaza.

“This is a moral, legal, and humanitarian imperative,” they added. “Civilians must have access to life-saving aid without obstruction or delay.”

The elected representatives on board the flotilla included politicians from Argentina, Brazil, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.

More than 160 other elected representatives also signed the statement in support of those on board.

Israel’s Ben-Gvir wants to designate flotilla volunteers as ‘terrorists’

Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir says he wants to designate all the Sumud Global Flotilla volunteers as “terrorists” and arrest them.

Ben-Gvir presented the plan at a discussion on Sunday to discuss measures to stop the flotilla from reaching the two million or so people trapped and starving in Gaza.

Attending the meeting were Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defence Minister Israel Katz, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer.

Under Ben-Gvir’s suggestion, any volunteers taken while trying to bring food and aid into Gaza will be held in Israel’s Ketziot and Damon prisons, which are used to hold “terrorists” under stringent conditions typically reserved for security prisoners.

“We will not allow individuals who support terrorism to live in comfort. They will face the full consequences of their actions,” Ben-Gvir, who was convicted of inciting terrorism in 2007, said.

Images: Global Sumud Flotilla leaving Barcelona

By Al Jazeera Staff

After delays due to weather, vessels taking part in the Global Sumud Flotilla set sail from Barcelona on Monday.

On board the vessels, along with Greta Thunberg, humanitarian activist Thiago Avila and roughly 350 other activists, is journalist and photographer Mauricio Morales, who will be reporting for Al Jazeera from one of the ships, the Alma.

Activists from 44 countries, including journalists, politicians, environmentalists, doctors and humanitarians had either used the extra time granted by the delay to either rest on board, or source additional supplies for Gaza, Morales said.

“Morale remained high, but uncertainty lingered about the exact departure time and whether a shifting political situation might delay or even block the flotilla’s exit from Barcelona,” Morales wrote from on board the Alma. “Sabotage was considered a real risk, and organisers were cautious about sharing sensitive information, wary of individuals seen filming the boats and crews.”

Drones spotted above Sumud Flotilla

By Mauricio Morales

Reporting from on board the Alma, off the Mediterranean coast of Spain

The rough weather that plagued the start of the Sumud Flotilla’s journey lingered into Tuesday morning, leaving some of the 24 volunteers on the Alma seasick. Exhausted, some volunteers found whatever corner they could to rest, even on the floor of the vessel, which was never designed to carry so many passengers.

The organisers of the flotilla assessed the damage after the storm, and instructed the vessels to regroup on a new course. Some boats had sustained damage, but have still been able to sail.

Daily life at sea quickly mixed political talks with chores: cleaning toilets, cooking, securing cargo, checking medical supplies, and rotating through security guard duty while discussing the political motives or the question that begins to resonate: “Why are you here?”

When the dark of the night began to settle to mark the end of the day, the Alma alarm blared, and everybody scrambled to the deck and put on their life jackets.

Two drones were hovering above the vessel, and communications from other boats reported the drones, as well. With the boat’s lights turned off, the flickering lights of the drones could be seen hovering over the vessel, before they eventually left, leaving those on the Alma silent, and wary.

On board the Familia setting off from Barcelona is Ada Colau Ballano, an activist and the former mayor of the city of Barcelona from 2015 to 2023. She is the first woman to have held the position of Barcelona’s mayor.

Colau Ballano previously took part in a 2014 flotilla from Istanbul that Israel intercepted.

“What’s wonderful is that this time, from my own city, Barcelona, the biggest attempt of all is setting out with 20 boats, and it’s going to be very difficult for [Israel] to stop us from reaching Gaza,” she told Al Jazeera.

Colau Ballano was seen hugging her children and saying goodbye before setting sail.

“My children and I have always spoken very openly about how the world is, and we’ve talked about what’s happening in Gaza and in Palestine, and it’s something that is part of our daily life at home, so they’re very aware,” she said.

“My little one started to cry when he saw I was really getting on the boat, but he perfectly understands the reasons,” Colau Ballano said.

“He knows that thousands of boys and girls are being killed and that today it’s for them, tomorrow it will be for others, but we can’t allow it and so my children encouraged me to get on the flotilla, even though they may worry about me a little, but they encouraged me to go because they know what’s at stake and they totally support the cause.”

What happened to past Freedom Flotillas?

Several Freedom Flotilla vessels have attempted to break the blockade of Gaza.

Two boats from the Free Gaza Movement successfully reached Gaza in 2008. It was the first breach of Israel’s naval blockade.

The movement, founded in 2006 by activists during Israel’s war on Lebanon, went on to launch 31 boats between 2008 and 2016, five of which reached Gaza despite heavy Israeli restrictions.

But since 2010, all flotillas attempting to break the Gaza blockade have been illegally intercepted or attacked by Israel in international waters.

In 2010, Israeli commandos raided the Mavi Marmara in international waters, killing 10 activists and injuring dozens, leading to global outrage.

The ship was carrying humanitarian aid and more than 600 passengers.

In July 2025, the Handala was intercepted in the Mediterranean Sea.

Genoa port workers threaten lockdown if Israel harasses Flotilla

On Saturday, port workers from Genoa, Italy, issued a stark challenge to Israeli authorities should they attempt to intercept the flotilla, as they have previous ones.

“Around mid-September, these boats will arrive near the coast of Gaza. If we lose contact with our boats, with our comrades, even for just 20 minutes, we will shut down all of Europe,” an unidentified dockworker from the Unione Sindacale di Base Confederazione Nazionale (USB) told crowds over the weekend in a widely circulated video.

“From this region 13 to 14,000 containers leave every year for Israel, not a single nail will leave anymore,” he added.

Everything you need to know about the Flotilla

The Global Sumud Flotilla for Gaza has set out towards Gaza after a false start on Sunday.

Hundreds of people are on board about 15 vessels, including journalists, doctors, politicians, humanitarians and activists from 44 countries.

The flotilla’s planned first stop is Tunisia, where they will link up with other ships.

They will be joined by more boats from Italy and other undisclosed ports in an effort to break Israel’s illegal siege on Gaza, which is starving Palestinians to death as Israel’s war on Gaza continues.

The volunteers hope to transport much-needed food and medicine to besieged Palestinians and to open a humanitarian corridor, allowing more civilian vessels to follow.

This is the largest effort to break Israel’s siege on Gaza and follows previous attempts dating back to 2010. Israel intercepted and sometimes attacked past flotillas.

‘It’s not about us, it’s about Gaza’

Before departing from Barcelona on Sunday, hundreds of volunteers on the Sumud Flotilla stressed that the “news story” is not them, but the hundreds of thousands of people dying from Israel’s genocide in Gaza.

“We are not heroes. We are not the story. The story is about the people of Gaza,” said Thiago Avila, a lifelong activist for Palestine and an organiser for the flotilla.

Many others on board the Flotilla echoed that sentiment and stressed that they were compelled to join the flotilla due to the distressing and horrific images of Palestinian children being relentlessly killed and starved to death.

“I love my daughter so much, as the mothers and fathers in Gaza [love their children], and because of this love. We cannot leave a world like this,” said Avila.

“We have to change the society that enables a genocide to happen,” he told Al Jazeera.

Sumud Flotilla perseveres, departs Barcelona despite bad weather

By Al Jazeera Staff

The Global Sumud Flotilla has departed Barcelona on Monday evening after having had to return to port on Sunday due to bad weather.

Conditions are still far from ideal, with six of the smaller vessels already having had to return to port for repairs.

However, dozens of vessels remain, each carrying desperately needed aid for the blockaded Gaza Strip along with about 350 activists.

115,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/4/russia-says-it-will-not-discuss-foreign-troops-in-ukraine-in-any-format,"Russia has flatly rejected the prospect of any talks that consider the deployment of foreign troops in Ukraine.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that Moscow would not entertain discussion of an international post-conflict security force “in any format”.

“Russia is not going to discuss the fundamentally unacceptable and security-undermining foreign intervention in Ukraine in any form, in any format,” Zakharova told reporters on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok.

Zakharova said that European leaders, who are working on plans for a multinational force in the event of an agreement to end the war in Ukraine, should take note that the “next time they aim to discuss this topic, they should have a pointer in the form of Russia’s position”.

“Judging by Ukraine’s losses, the European Commission has simply outdone itself,” she said.

Zakharova made her comments after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told The Financial Times earlier this week that the European Union had “pretty precise plans” for deploying a multinational force to Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders are set to meet in Paris on Thursday to firm up details of post-conflict security guarantees for Kyiv.

On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron said the details of the security guarantees for Ukraine had been worked out but remained “extremely confidential”.

“We are ready, we the Europeans, to offer the security guarantees to Ukraine and Ukrainians the day that a peace [accord] is signed,” Macron said.

Despite United States President Donald Trump’s pledge to bring a swift end to the conflict, Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on the terms of any potential peace agreement.
Russia has said that any deal with Ukraine would need to include land in four regions it has annexed since 2022, while Kyiv has ruled out ceding any territory.

Trump is scheduled to speak with Zelenskyy by phone on Thursday, and has said he intends to speak to Putin in the coming days.","Russia has categorically rejected any discussions about the post-war deployment of foreign troops or international security forces in Ukraine. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova asserted that Moscow considers any foreign intervention in Ukraine “fundamentally unacceptable,” and would refuse to engage in talks on this issue in any context or format.

Her statement comes in response to recent remarks by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who indicated that the EU has detailed plans for sending a multinational force to Ukraine in the event of a peace deal. European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, are preparing to offer Ukraine comprehensive security guarantees, with details reportedly kept confidential for now.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and EU officials are set to meet in Paris to discuss these potential security arrangements. Zakharova criticized these European efforts, referencing Ukraine’s heavy losses and warning the EU to pay attention to Russia’s uncompromising position on the issue.

Although US President Donald Trump has pledged to bring a quick end to the conflict, Russia and Ukraine remain far apart on a potential resolution. Moscow insists on any peace agreement including recognition of Russian claims to four annexed regions, while Kyiv refuses to cede any territory. Trump is expected to speak with both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin in an attempt to move diplomacy forward.",0,0,0,0,0

Its 14th-century wooden pillars have been witnesses to centuries of sermons and struggle.

When Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, the spiritual leader of Kashmir’s Muslims, rises to speak, he does so with grace but caution. Draped in his customary golden-bordered white thobe and crowned with a brown Karakuli hat, he delivers a sermon laced with quiet prayers.

“As we enter the new Islamic year,” he said, “I extend greetings to the entire Muslim Ummah. May Allah grant us peace, unity and strength, protect the oppressed, and guide our leaders with wisdom and righteousness in these testing times.”

His tone is unrecognisable from just a few years ago, when the now 52-year-old mirwaiz – as Kashmir’s chief Muslim leader is known – was a fiery orator, thundering with conviction, his speeches a powerful cocktail of religious messaging and politics.

For almost three decades, Kashmir’s supreme Muslim leader was also one of the region’s most influential voices arguing for its independence from India through peaceful dialogue, at a time when the valley was a cauldron of violence. An armed secessionist struggle that kicked off in the 1980s led to a massive Indian security presence in Kashmir, and since then, more than 40,000 people have been killed according to Indian government estimates.

Farooq’s speeches would often invoke Kashmir’s right to independence. Seven years ago, on June 2, 2018, for instance, the mosque brimmed with more than 30,000 worshippers. Farooq, visibly impassioned, ascended the pulpit.

“This pulpit will never fall silent,” he proclaimed. “The Jamia mimbar will continue to speak truth and be on the side of justice … Kashmir is our nation, only we will decide its fate.”

The crowd erupted. Chants of “Azaadi [freedom]!” thundered within the mosque.

But Kashmir has since changed: In 2019, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi unilaterally revoked Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status, guaranteed at the time under the Indian Constitution, which was followed by a security clampdown and administrative restrictions. Thousands were arrested, including Farooq, who was placed under house arrest. It would be four years before he was released in 2023.
On this Friday, it seems like Farooq has changed, too. Gone is the defiant rhetoric that once defined him. There are no overt political cues in his sermon, only verses from scripture, calls for patience, and appeals for community calm.

The crowd listens. Respectful, but unlike in earlier years, unmoved.

Outside, across Kashmir, a question is beginning to take hold. Few say it out aloud, but the conversations are real: Is the head-priest adapting to survive in a changed Kashmir, or is he fading into irrelevance?

Who is the mirwaiz?

In Kashmir’s complex political and spiritual landscape, few figures embody both reverence and endurance quite like Mirwaiz Umar Farooq. Thrust into public life at the age of 17 after the assassination of his father – the previous mirwaiz – in 1990, allegedly by rebels from a Pakistan-backed armed group, Farooq inherited not just the pulpit, but a legacy.

As the mirwaiz of Kashmir, his official role was rooted in religious scholarship. But in Kashmir, the mimbar is rarely just theological.

Farooq quickly emerged as a distinctive voice – soft-spoken, scholarly and deliberate. Unlike many contemporaries who were drawn towards the growing armed uprising of the 1990s, Farooq chose the path of nonviolence and negotiation. As the valley slipped deeper into militarised conflict, he became a leading figure in the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), a coalition advocating for a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the Kashmir dispute.

Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, though both control parts of it. In Indian-administered Kashmir, meanwhile, pro-independence sentiments have simmered since 1947, when the region acceded to India at the time of partition.

Farooq positioned himself as a moderate, walking the tightrope between street sentiment and diplomatic possibility. “Mirwaiz Umar has always positioned himself as a moderate politician, a believer in the institution of dialogue and someone who has been flexible in his political stance,” said Gowhar Geelani, author-journalist and political analyst. “The head priest has shown willingness to talk with all stakeholders, including the nation states of Pakistan and India, and different civil society coalitions within and outside Kashmir.”

At a time when most separatist leaders rejected talks with the Indian state as betrayal, Farooq broke ranks. In 2004, he led a Hurriyat delegation to meet Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Delhi, calling it “a step forward that could open doors to understanding.” He later held several rounds of talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Vajpayee’s successor, raising issues like troop withdrawal, demilitarisation of civilian zones and Kashmir’s autonomy.

“We are not against India,” he said after one such meeting. “We are for Kashmiris. Dialogue is the only way out of this decades-long tragedy.”

Geelani explained that this approach, while distinctive, came with its own political risks: Different sections of the ideological spectrum in Kashmir viewed Farooq with “admiration, caution and suspicion”, he said.

The overtures to the Indian government – bold at the time – cost Farooq support among hardliner separatists but also positioned him as a rare figure willing to negotiate without abandoning the demand for self-determination. His political gamble was seen by many as an attempt to humanise Kashmir’s struggle and push for a peaceful resolution, while retaining the moral authority of the pulpit.

At the heart of the mirwaiz’s ability to play that role was his influence – a stature of a kind that no other pro-independence leaders in Kashmir could boast of. And that influence was centred at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid.

Before 2019, when Kashmir still held its special status, Fridays at the mosque were charged events. Farooq’s sermons, laced with Islamic insight and political longing, moved overflowing congregations.

After August 2019, when India revoked Kashmir’s special status and the mirwaiz was arrested alongside thousands of others, the 600-year-old mosque too has occasionally been closed under security orders. Sermons were replaced by silence.

The return in 2023

On a grey September morning in Srinagar in 2023, the air hung heavy with a mix of apprehension and subdued hope at Jamia Masjid, as Mirwaiz Umar Farooq returned to the pulpit – gentler now. His shoulders, once firm with certainty, seemed slightly stooped. His gaze, formerly sharp and searching, now lingered, softer, more introspective. The fire was gone.

Tight security manned every alley; worshippers queued in long lines, many weeping silently as they glimpsed the mirwaiz step forward.

“This is the time for patience,” he said, pausing often, his tone deliberate. Gone were the calls for a plebiscite for Kashmiris to decide on their future, for resistance to what he once called “Indian occupation”.

Instead, there was a softened plea for dialogue, not between nations, but with Kashmiris.

Once, he thundered, “Nobody can silence us.” That day on his return to the mosque in September 2023, he said: “Perhaps no one is ready to listen to us.”

Fast forward two years, and last month, as tensions peaked between India and Pakistan following India’s retaliation over the Pahalgam attack, he spoke to mourn the war’s youngest victims, Zain and Urwa. The twin children had been killed in Pakistani shelling. The mirwaiz said their “smiling image will haunt us”.

“Kashmir is a bleeding wound,” he said. “A flashpoint that can explode anytime.” His audience, which would once erupt into chants, listened silently.

In January, Farooq travelled to New Delhi to attend a meeting of a parliamentary panel on amendments to a law that governs Muslim endowments – known as waqf – across India and Indian-administered Kashmir. It was his first formal engagement with the Indian state since 2019, prompting speculation about – as yet unconfirmed – renewed communication between the mirwaiz and Delhi.

A separate meeting with a member of parliament from the National Conference, a mainstream Kashmiri party that swears by the Indian Constitution and won last year’s state legislature election, further fuelled chatter that the mirwaiz might be exploring a political compromise with New Delhi.

Al Jazeera reached out to the mirwaiz for an interview, but has not received any response.

Analysts suggest that Farooq’s recent public engagements – including appearances at interfaith and national events in Delhi – reflect a cautious recalibration rather than a clear ideological shift. The mirwaiz now appears to be navigating a drastically altered political terrain, where symbolism and strategic networking – particularly with Indian Muslims facing their own constraints under the rule of Modi’s Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party – may be the only forms of relevance still available.

“This is not so much a shift in ideology as it is a response to shrinking space,” said Anuradha Bhasin, senior journalist and political analyst. “He has always been a symbolic figure, straddling the religious and the political. In this charged political climate, not just separatists but even mainstream political actors have been left with very little room for articulation.

“What we’re seeing now is survival within that narrow space. He has been mostly under house arrest for the last six years, and the Hurriyat has completely disappeared – so he’s isolated.”

Still, questions about the mirwaiz and his careful sermons are dividing young Kashmiris.

Silence or strategy?

Conversations with young Kashmiris, from college campuses to downtown Srinagar cafes, reveal a quiet disillusionment with the mirwaiz among some. “He’s more a preacher now than a leader,” said Aqib Nazir, a journalism student, about a man once seen as among Kashmir’s most prominent political voices.

His moderation, once seen as a strength, is increasingly interpreted as powerlessness by this set of Kashmiris – as quiet capitulation.

But for others, the mirwaiz still holds symbolic significance. They interpret his more restrained sermons as a sign of maturity and pragmatism – a conscious effort to protect the mosque’s role as a vital space for spiritual continuity and communal gathering.

In a context where public life is closely monitored and expressions of dissent are often scrutinised, some believe this approach helps maintain a space for religious life without drawing undue attention or risking further restrictions.

“He’s the last moral voice we’ve got,” said Asif, a Srinagar resident who’s listened to the mirwaiz for more than 10 years.

“His restraint isn’t weakness – it’s survival.”","The article chronicles the evolution of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Kashmir’s chief Muslim cleric and once-fiery advocate for Kashmiri independence, against the backdrop of dramatic political change in Indian-administered Kashmir. Once renowned for his powerful, sometimes defiant sermons in Srinagar’s historic Jamia Masjid—where calls for self-determination routinely prompted mass mobilization—Farooq’s tone has shifted dramatically since the 2019 revocation of Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status, which was followed by his house arrest and a sweeping crackdown on dissent.

Now, Farooq’s sermons focus on scriptural guidance and calls for patience, notable for the absence of explicit political content. While he was once a key moderate voice for dialogue with both India and Pakistan (even meeting Indian Prime Ministers Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh), his public stance has softened considerably, sparking debate among Kashmiris over whether this is a strategic retreat for survival or a slide toward irrelevance. Some youth now see him more as a preacher than a political leader; others defend his moderation as prudent in a heavily surveilled and restricted public sphere.

The article situates Farooq’s journey within Kashmir’s wider history of rebellion, violence, and the abrupt narrowing of the region’s political space under India’s BJP-led government. It notes that Farooq's only recent overtures have been to attend select national or interfaith meetings, prompting speculation about a possible realignment or dialogue with New Delhi. Throughout, the article highlights both the nostalgia for his earlier leadership and the difficult realities of maintaining moral or political influence in the face of relentless state pressure, surveillance, and the collapse of the separatist movement’s organizational framework.",0,0,0,1,0
117,https://www.deccanherald.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir/bedroom-jihadis-become-a-nuisance-for-security-agencies-in-jammu-and-kashmir-3677131,"Security agencies in Jammu and Kashmir are facing a unique modern threat: so-called “bedroom jihadis,” individuals who, unlike traditional armed militants, operate from the safety and anonymity of their homes. Instead of direct violence, they are engaged in sophisticated cross-border campaigns conducted largely via social media and messaging apps. According to officials, these campaigns are designed to destabilize the region, provoke communal discord, and influence impressionable youth.

Investigations have revealed that networks of social media handles—mostly originating in Pakistan—regularly coordinate efforts to spread rumors, falsehoods, and provocative content aimed at Kashmiri society. Law enforcement identified a surge in “bedroom jihadi” activity following the region’s successful 2024 assembly elections, with intelligence suggesting that these coordinated campaigns were intended to hinder the functioning of the new administration and reignite tensions.

Officials describe how these actors exploit sensitive events—such as religious festivals or incidents involving Kashmiri Pandits—to incite unrest. For example, recent attempts to leak personal details of Pandit migrants and stoke sectarian tensions during Muharram were quickly neutralized by the authorities. The term “bedroom jihadi” refers to their method: waging a “bloody war fought with words,” primarily through digital platforms like X (formerly Twitter).

The proliferation of such online activism is not limited to Kashmir, drawing participation from youth elsewhere in India and the diaspora. Security agencies claim these efforts are closely linked to handlers based in Pakistan, with some local actors being detained for their role in disseminating inflammatory messages.

Authorities see this virtual campaign as a serious challenge—one that compounds the difficulties of traditional anti-terror operations in the region. They warn that in an era where rumors can spread rapidly, the collective impact of “bedroom jihadis” poses a new kind of threat to peace and stability in Jammu and Kashmir.","Complete Summary
Security agencies in Jammu and Kashmir are facing a new and increasingly complex threat from so-called ""bedroom jihadis."" These individuals, distinct from traditional armed militants, use social media and digital platforms from the safety of their homes to spread misinformation, incite communal discord, and destabilize the region. Officials claim this is part of a sophisticated, cross-border effort, primarily orchestrated by terror groups and sympathizers based in Pakistan.

Investigations have revealed networks of social media accounts controlled from across the border, which actively infiltrate local digital spaces to disseminate inflammatory content and propaganda. This hidden digital campaign seeks to provoke sectarian clashes and unrest among Kashmir’s diverse communities. The trend was first observed in 2017 and resurfaced after the successful 2024 assembly elections, potentially aimed at destabilizing the newly elected government.

Law enforcement has responded by scrutinizing thousands of posts, messages, and accounts, uncovering links between online activities and handlers in Pakistan. Recent incidents include the leaking of personal information of Kashmiri Pandit migrants to create fear, and attempts to provoke tension during Muharram, which were swiftly contained by police.

Authorities have coined the term ""bedroom jihadis"" because these actors wage what they describe as a “bloody war fought with words” in the virtual realm. The influence of such propaganda is significant, especially among youth, and the ease of spreading rumors on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) poses a major challenge. Preventive detentions and arrests have been made among those found to be directly involved.

The digital conflict extends beyond Jammu and Kashmir, drawing in youth from other parts of India and abroad. Officials stress that while traditional terrorism remains a concern, the digital battlefield is an increasingly important front in efforts to destabilize the region.",1,1,0,1,0
